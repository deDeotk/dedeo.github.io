<blockquote><p>
  In the greater part of these recent works on St. Thomas Auinas one notes a preference for the analytic method. To be sure, this method had its merits. It was necessary to call attention to the theses, the theories, the several parts of the system, just as when seeking to make a person known, we begin by describing his life with its most noteworthy facts and salient exploits, as well as its most minute episodes and many seemingly negligible details. Every point of the Thomistic conception is scrutinized, illumined, discussed. After the manner of hardy explorers, the students of St. Thomas, in their loving solicitude to trace its lines with due precision, have not overlooked a single outskirt of this hallowed ground.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Olgiati then proceeds to describe the synthetic method of which his trenchant <em>Key</em> elucidates as a case in point:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Hitherto, however, the synthetic method has not received the attention it deserves. It would seem that after the painstaking and valuable researches along the way of analysis, not enough stress has been laid on pointing out to the men of our age the wonderful unity of the whole system. Frequently, even in otherwise eminent and learned works, the manifold doctrines engross the reader’s attention without making him feel the beauty and vibration of the one and only spirit that breathes life into the whole. So it happens that many, especially among its opponents, imagine they have understood Thomism, [all] the while as a matter of fact the <em>soul</em> of St. Thomas eludes their grasp. (pp. iv–v)
</p></blockquote>
<p>The power of the sapiential approach is not in its manifold distinctions but in its striving toward synthesis; to the analytic “he who distinguishes well learns well” must be added the synthetic “distinguish to unite” if one is to penetrate “the wonderful unity of the whole system.”</p>
<p>Why? The metaphysician moves from the appearances of things to their essences, from <em>ens</em> to <em>ratio entis</em>, from participated beings to First Being, from effects to First (and Final) Cause.<sup id="fnref-1333-2"><a href="#fn-1333-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> The theologian moves from the <em>logoi</em> of Holy Scripture to the <em>Logos</em>, from revelation deposited to revelation cogitated, from tenets of faith scattered to a body of divinity. Both perform unitive cognitive acts, referring all things to their chief and highest ends. Rarely is one person gifted with the extraordinary grace, genius, and wisdom required to perform both unitive acts in a preeminent degree. Such is the case with the <em>doctor communis</em>.</p>
<p>And such is the case too in its own way with the neo-Calvinist lights such as Kuyper and Bavinck and their intellectual forebearers, the Reformed orthodox doctors, as is slowly being recognized in contemporary Reformed Protestantism. To speculate for a minute in this digression, if someone ventured a similar synthetic study either of Bavinck’s <em>Dogmatiek</em> in particular or of Reformed dogmatics in general, I wonder whether the answer to “What is the Key?” would be similar to Olgiati’s answer with respect to Thomas.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, it seems desirable that we scholars in the field of systematic theology would every now and then take leave of the unending stream of analytic studies and pose to ourselves the synthetic questions lest we be found mistaking parts of the body for the soul, or, what might be worse, forgetting that there is a soul in our field to be found.</p>
<p>Along this line the outline of Bavinck&#8217;s <em>Dogmatics</em> provides a small opportunity to apply a synthetic <em>formalgegenstand</em> and to taste the “wonderful unity.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan-Baptist_Jozef_Walgrave">J. H. Walgrave</a>, “<a href="https://books.google.be/books?id=Ld-1VEnerwsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=nl&amp;pg=PA181#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">The Use of Philosophy in the Theology of Thomas Aquinas</a>,” in <i>Aquinas and Problems of His Time</i>, ed. G. Verbeke and D. Verhelst, Mediaevalia Lovaniensia 1 (The Hague: Leuven University Press, 1976), 181–93.</strong></p>
<p>Walgrave’s concise and sound explanation of Thomas Aquinas’s view on how <em>theologia sacrae scripturae</em> relates to <em>theologia philosophica</em>, or more broadly faith to reason, grace to nature, is well worth the perusal. Walgrave focuses his attention on the first of these couplets, elucidating several key passages and principles at play in Aquinas’s thought on this perennial question. More can be said on each of these couplets,<sup id="fnref-1309-1"><a href="#fn-1309-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> but not less, if, that is, one is to accurately represent the rudiments of Thomas’s position.</p>
<p>To venture a brief historical digression where a lowly American Presbyterian dares to tread on the theology-philosophy-relation question, the patient Protestant reader who is willing to set aside one’s twentieth-century Barthian, Dutch Reformed, Modern Protestant, or otherwise “Christomonistic,” “antithetical,” “anti-scholastic,” and “anti-Hellenization” preconceptions and read Thomas afresh for oneself might be surprised to find not a rationalist, dualistic enemy who, to borrow Walgrave’s phrases, everywhere reduces theology <em>sub metis philosophiae</em> but a champion of faith’s preeminence, a friend of Holy Scripture’s supreme authority, who everywhere reduces philosophy <em>ad metas fidei</em>.</p>
<p>And, to digress further, if one’s Protestant patience were to extend far enough to proceed from perusing the corpus Thomisticum on this perennial question to the 16th- and 17-century Reformed confessional and dogmatic writings on the same, one might be surprised again to find the rudiments of the Thomistic formulations reappearing not infrequently in the writings of the sharpest theological minds within Reformed orthodoxy.</p>
<p>Yet even apart from possible connections into Protestant ressourcement questions, Walgrave’s essay is a worthy companion to the first question in <em>ST</em> and to a fundamental theme in Aquinas’s thought.</p>

<blockquote><p>Again, the sight of God is twofold. One is perfect, whereby God&#8217;s Essence is seen: the other is imperfect, whereby, though we see not what God is, yet we see what He is not; and whereby, the more perfectly do we know God in this life, the more we understand that He surpasses all that the mind comprehends. Each of these visions of God belongs to the gift of understanding; the first, to the gift of understanding in its state of perfection, as possessed in heaven; the second, to the gift of understanding in its state of inchoation, as possessed by wayfarers.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right; font-size: .8em;">—Aquinas, <em>ST</em> <a href="http://dhspriory.org/thomas/summa/SS/SS008.html#SSQ8A7THEP1">2–2.8.7 corpus</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">God eludes the conception of our intellect because he transcends all that our mind conceives of him; but not so that our intellect is in no intelligible way likened to him.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is because human intelligence is not equal to the divine essence that this same divine essence surpasses our intelligence and is unknown to us: wherefore man reaches the highest point of his knowledge about God when he knows that he knows him not, inasmuch as he knows that that which is God transcends whatsoever he conceives of him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right; font-size: .8em;">—Aquinas, <em>De potentia</em> <a href="http://dhspriory.org/thomas/QDdePotentia7.htm#7:5">7.5 ad 13–14</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Whenever there is anything which corresponds to the concept we have of the word knowledge, of it we know not only that it is but also what it is, for knowledge is a distinct reality. But, as Damascene says, “we cannot know what God is, but only that He is.” Therefore, in God there is nothing corresponding to our concept expressed by knowledge. Knowledge, therefore, does not exist in God.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right; font-size: .8em;">—Aquinas, <em>De veritate</em> <a href="http://dhspriory.org/thomas/QDdeVer2.htm#1">2.1 ad 9</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>God as an unknown is said to be the terminus of our knowledge in the following respect: that the mind is found to be most perfectly in possession of knowledge of God when it is recognized that His essence is above everything that the mind is capable of apprehending in this life; and thus, although what He is remains unknown, yet it is known that He is.</p></blockquote>
