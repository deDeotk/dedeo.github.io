<p>The metaphysician, faced with someone who denies the first principles, or even with the task of judging the first principles, does no more than call to our attention the more searching eye already present in us all — merely reaches back more searchingly than does the ethician to what we all know. And, in that perspective, the first principles stand exposed as an intelligible hierarchy, a sequence of visions each flowing from its intelligible predecessor; and in that vision, “good” derives from “a being,” or, if one will, “ought” from “is.”</p></blockquote>

<p>There really does seem to be a permanent war about being (as Plato suggested in the <em>Sophist</em>). We should expect to have to battle concerning purpose in nature, concerning substantial form and matter, concerning the immateriality of cognition, concerning the immortality of the human soul, and the existence of God, and creational causality, concerning our very ability to know being and truth. The Presocratics are always with us.</p></blockquote>

Boyle" width="197" height="300" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-902" class="wp-caption-text">Prof. John F. Boyle</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the first chapter of his <a href="http://udallas.edu/news/2013/31st-annual-aquinas-lecture-to-feature-professor-john-boyle.html">2013 Aquinas Lecture</a> at the University of Dallas (published as <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BwLDngEACAAJ"><em>Master Thomas Aquinas and the Fulness of Life</em></a>), Professor John Boyle makes a simple observation about the stark Medieval-modern shift in understanding of the nature of theology as a science that I find profound and worthy of a brief self-reflection and expansion; namely, that the modern drive for encyclopedic knowledge (i.e., fields of knowledge literally organized alphabetically; that is, by an <em>extrinsic</em> organizing principle that has no organic relation to the body of knowledge itself) indicates not simply a change in the quantity of knowledge (the explosion of scientific knowledge in the modern period and a corresponding need to find a quick and handy way to organize all the new knowledge) but more radically and more importantly a change in the quality or nature of scientific knowledge: from wisdom to cataloguing, generalization to specialization, knowledge according to causes (pl.) to knowledge according to cause (sg., usually efficient cause alone).</p>
<p>The medieval period was an age of <em>summae</em>, notes Boyle, precisely because it was widely held that the educated person was not a cataloguer of data but a seeker of wisdom, one who strives to see the order that exists within a body of knowledge according to the principles inherent in that body—according to its <em>intrinsic</em> organizing principles—and then draws out the implications and relations of those principles for that field of knowledge. The seeker of wisdom also sees her own field of knowledge as itself related to a larger order of causation, a First Mover, an ultimate end and highest good from which all being and knowledge derive and to which they proceed. Fittingly, Boyle points to the wise man in the first chapter of Aquinas’ <em>Summa contra Gentiles</em> as an example par excellence.</p>
<p><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BwLDngEACAAJ"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-905" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Boyle_MasterThomas.jpeg" alt="Master Thomas Aquinas and the Fullness of Life by John f. Boyle" width="128" height="199" /></a>To expand the medieval-modern-shift idea beyond Boyle’s lecture to include the present Internet age poses a contrast of the same genus albeit not of the exact same species: the internet-based (or the mathematical [i.e., the algorithmic, search engine-based]) organizing principle of knowledge is similar to the alphabetic-based principle insofar as both are extrinsic to the body of knowledge itself. And expanding our gaze in this way, it seems to me, leaves us with the same problem today with the mathematical approach as with the earlier alphabetic approach: for all the growth in human access to data and quantity of data, we fail to see a corresponding growth in wisdom, the ordering of knowledge to a final, perfect purpose beyond that knowledge itself.</p>
<p>I’m generalizing egregiously here, I know. Yet if I failed to state the obvious—albeit the hard to quantify obvious&#8230;how does one measure wisdom or the lack thereof?—I fear I would be deceiving myself equally as egregiously about the warp and woof of the present age and the current attitude toward scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>If I make a final quick turn to consider my own humble field of study—sacra doctrina—I might venture to say thinking about how one proceeds to order theological material (i.e., what extrinsic or intrinsic principles are at play) seems to hold promise, at the very least, for figuring out which theological movements are out of balance and mere fads (i.e., ordered mostly by extrinsic principles) and which are rooted in the perennial, intrinsic principles inherent, rooted deep down, in supernatural revelation and held in balance without one part, principle, or nuance dominating the richness of the whole.</p>
<p>Whether or not theology (or any other field of knowledge for that matter) will see another age of <em>summae</em>-making or the revival of fourfold causality, the ordering of knowledge to wisdom, and the like, pursuing this elusive end in theological science—or at the very least reminding the church that such wisdom is an important, several-centuries-long chapter in her story—might just be one of theology’s most precious gifts she can give to the church in her contemporary administration of the covenant of grace as teacher of sacred doctrine.</p>
