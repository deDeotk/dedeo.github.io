<blockquote><p>Now I would remind you, brothers, of the gospel I preached to you, which you received, in which you stand, and by which you are being saved, if you hold fast to the word I preached to you—unless you believed in vain.</p>
<p>For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles. Last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me. For I am the least of the apostles, unworthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me was not in vain. On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them, though it was not I, but the grace of God that is with me. Whether then it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed.</p>
<p>Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain. We are even found to be misrepresenting God, because we testified about God that he raised Christ, whom he did not raise if it is true that the dead are not raised. For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised. And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins. Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. If in Christ we have hope in this life only, we are of all people most to be pitied.</p>
<p>But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.</p></blockquote>

<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-256" alt="WaterDroplet" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/WaterDroplet.jpg" width="300" height="200" />That the resurrected Christ continually intercedes for all his people from the Father&#8217;s heavenly throne is a deep well of grace. In this catechetical sermon I draw&nbsp;living water from this wonderful well by unfolding the <a href="http://opc.org/lc.html">Larger Catechism’s</a> teaching on Jesus’s heavenly intercession:</p>
<blockquote><p>Q. 55. How doth Christ make intercession?<br />
A. Christ maketh intercession, by his appearing in our nature continually before the Father in heaven, in the merit of his obedience and sacrifice on earth, declaring his will to have it applied to all believers; answering all accusations against them, and procuring for them quiet of conscience, notwithstanding daily failings, access with boldness to the throne of grace, and acceptance of their persons and services.</p></blockquote>
<p>I use Moses’s temporary, earthly, and inglorious intercession in Exodus 32 as a backdrop for contrasting Jesus’s eternal, heavenly, and glorious intercession of which Jesus gives us a glimpse in his high priestly prayer (John 17:9).</p>
