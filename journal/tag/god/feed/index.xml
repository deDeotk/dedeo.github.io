				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If mystery is the lifeblood of dogmatics (HT: Bavinck), it is because God is its very life and heart.</p>
<p>Thomas Aquinas well summarizes the classical teaching on the heart/object of theology:</p>
<blockquote><p>But sacred doctrine is chiefly concerned with God. . . .<sup>1</sup></p></blockquote>
<p>And again:</p>
<blockquote><p>. . . the chief aim of sacred doctrine is to teach the knowledge of God, not only as He is in Himself, but also as He is the beginning of things and their last end, and especially of rational creatures. . . .<sup>2</sup></p></blockquote>
<p>The Protestant doctors in the period of Reformed orthodoxy appropriated this catholic wisdom concerning the <em>locus de Deo. </em>For instance, Francis Turretin (1623–1687) writes concerning the object of sacred doctrine that:</p>
<blockquote><p>the more common and true opinion is that of those who refer it to God and divine things. . . . Thus that all things are discussed in theology either because they deal with God himself or have a relation (<em>schesin</em>) to him as the first principle and ultimate end.<sup>3</sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Additionally, the <a href="http://www.reformation21.org/articles/synopsis-purioris-theologiae.php">Leiden Synopsis</a> exclaims regarding the role of the locus de Deo in “most-sacred theology” that:</p>
<blockquote><p>God is treated not only as the principle upon which it is constructed and the source of our knowledge of it but also as the subject and the foremost, primary (<em>primus ac primarius</em>) <em>locus</em> of Theology from which all the others flow forth, by which they are held together, and to which they should be directed.<sup>4</sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Herman Bavinck (1854–1921), perhaps one of the last of the modern Protestant doctors who operated unapologetically within the tradition of Protestant orthodoxy, expresses this same commitment in the introduction to his treatment of the doctrine of God:</p>
<blockquote><p>In truth, the knowledge that God has revealed of himself in nature and Scripture far surpasses human imagination and understanding. In that sense it is all mystery with which the science of dogmatics is concerned, for it does not deal with finite creatures, but from beginning to end looks past all creatures and focuses on the eternal and infinite One himself. From the very start of its labors, it faces the incomprehensible One. From him it derives its inception, for from him are all things. But also in the remaining loci, when it turns its attention to creatures, it views them only in relation to God as they exist from him and through him and for him [Rom. 11:36].</p>
<p>So then, the knowledge of God is the only dogma, the exclusive content, of the entire field of dogmatics. All the doctrines treated in dogmatics—whether they concern the universe, humanity, Christ, and so forth—are but the explication of the one central dogma of the knowledge of God. All things are considered in light of God, subsumed under him, traced back to him as the starting point. Dogmatics is always called upon to ponder and describe God and God alone, whose glory is in creation and re-creation, in nature and grace, in the world and in the church. It is the knowledge of him alone that dogmatics must put on display.<sup>5</sup></p></blockquote>
<p>I dig the classical dictum concerning theology that flows out of this perennial teaching: theology is taught by God, teaches God, and leads to God. Yet my experience reveals a discouragingly high failure rate at keeping my eyes aimed on this end even, ironically, amidst the very act of post-graduate study <em>of theology</em>.</p>
<p>In listening to my own <em>theologoi</em> and those of others, I am forced to conclude that the more one’s theological discourse loses sight of its true object (which, BTW, is the ever-present danger, strong temptation, and intense gravity under which all seminary students and teachers labor in the present evil age), the less of the divine mystery one tastes at the Lord’s table, sees in the Lord’s Word, senses in the Lord’s house, finds in the communion of the saints, and expresses in well-ordered theological words whether printed on the page or spoken in the lectern. Without the beating heart, the lifeblood is cold, static, dead.</p>
<p>But to dig even deeper here, albeit too briefly, if I&#8217;m honest with myself I see in my heart—that chamber of the most intimate, private theological discourse—that when my eyes droop, when in my “theologizing” I replace the object of theology with lesser objects that at the time seemed for whatever foolish reason greater than The Only Object (things like proving my view of such and such superior to another’s or chasing one of the million rabbit trails to which my own curiosity leads or any other of the human vices that love to express themselves in academic study), my prayers either cease or hit the ceiling. They cease and/or they turn into meaningless platitudes: Lord help my kids, Lord give me this or that, blah blah. In these moments my “prayers” seem to become my conscience’s object lesson on the fact that the lifeblood has gone cold not only in my theology but in my heart.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is one of the reasons for the existence of re-orienting, gaze-lifting preparatory exercises such as the <a href="/journal/quotables/a-prayer-before-study/">student’s prayer</a>, preparation guidelines for Sabbath worship and communion given in the Reformed confessions, and the like. These humble things are wise prods for keeping theology’s main thing the main thing, which is much easier said than done even in doing theology.</p>

<p>The existence of an absolutely necessary being means there is a divine sustaining hand whose withdrawal means annihilation; it means that we cannot contact anything of reality without confronting divinity; that God is closer to us than we are to ourselves, that every moment of life, every particle of dust, every stitch of a garment is permeated with divinity or it could not continue to be. That there is an all perfect being means that all the beauty, the love, the goodness that lift the heart of a man out of himself are but shadows of the infinite on the pool of life, vague hints of the ineffable that lies at the beginning and end of life. That a supreme intelligence exists makes it plain that the hairs of our head are indeed numbered; that there is no step, no breath, no success or failure that is without its meaning, without its place in a divine plan, a supreme order, that necessarily goes beyond the human mind’s power of assimilation.</p></blockquote>

All men live in relation to God, but not everyone relates to God the same way. Hence the three monotheisms, for instance, can be distinguished according to how they draw the relation between God and man: Lord and servant or Father and son; covenant of works or covenant of grace; unmediated or mediated.</p>
<p>Thomas Manton’s <a href="http://archive.org/stream/practi00mant#page/n239/mode/2up">observation on James 1:27</a> highlights the world of difference it is to call upon God not only as Lord but also as Abba, Father—a distinct privilege of Christian monotheism:</p>
<blockquote><p>We serve God most comfortably when we consider him as a Father in Christ. Lord, Lord<em>, is not half so sweet as </em>Our Father<em>. Duty in the covenant of grace is far more comfortable, not only as we have more help, but because it is done in a sweeter relation. We are not servants, but have received the adoption of sons. Get an interest in God, that his work may be sweet to you. Mercies yield the more sweetness when they come not only from a Creator, but a Father; and duties are done with the more confidence when we can come into the presence of God, not as servants, but sons. A servant may use greater industry and pains than a son, and yet please less.</em></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Take in the weightiness of the matter. Ah! would you err in this point, in a business that doth so deeply intrench upon the honour of God? The mistake being so dangerous, he is the more earnest. Oh! do not err. The note is, that errors about the nature of God are very dangerous. There is nothing more natural to us than to have ill thoughts of God, and nothing more dangerous; all practice dependeth upon it, to keep the glory of God unstained in your apprehensions. You shall see, Rom. i. 23, 24, ‘They changed the glory of God,’ &amp;c., and then ‘God gave them up to uncleanness.’ Idolatry is often expressed by whoredom; bodily and spiritual uncleanness usually go together: ill thoughts of God debauch the spirit, and make men lose their sense and care of piety. Well, then, take heed of erring this error: let not the nature or glory of God be blemished in your thoughts; abhor whatever cometh into your mind, or may be suggested by others, if it tend any way to abate your esteem of God, or to eclipse the divine glory in your apprehensions.</p></blockquote>
