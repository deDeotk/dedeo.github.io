Todd Billings" width="150" height="150" /></a>Recently I came across <a href="http://www.jtoddbillings.com/">Prof. J. Todd Billings&#8217;s</a> thoughtful post on the Zondervan Academic blog: “<a href="http://zondervanacademic.com/blog/common-places-the-promise-and-prospects-of-retrieval-recent-developments-in-protestant-scholasticism/">The Promise and Prospects of Retrieval: Recent Developments in Protestant Scholasticism</a>.” Here Billings provides a brief survey of the academic waters in which my own student toes have been dipped—that strange and deep ocean of “Reformed scholasticism”—and suggests how this largely historical movement is positively influencing contemporary Reformed theology in North America. He sees the Reformed tradition in a light that I find to be eminently helpful and worthy of rediscovering; namely, being Reformed as a way of being the “one, holy catholic church” rather than being Reformed as an end in itself.</p>
<p>In passing Billings references his heartfelt essay “<a href="http://www.jtoddbillings.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Billings-Catholic-and-Reformed-Pro-Ecclesia1.pdf">Catholic and Reformed: Rediscovering a Tradition</a>,” <em>Pro Ecclesia</em> 23:2 (2014): 132–46, which sets forth a vision for Reformed catholicity in more depth vis-a-vis contemporary trends in Evangelical thought. Watch Billings deliver this essay in his inaugural lecture as Gordon H. Girod Research Professor of Reformed Theology at <a href="http://www.westernsem.edu/" target="_blank">Western Theological Seminary</a> in Holland, MI, below.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.brill.com/products/book/church-and-school-early-modern-protestantism"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-449" title="Festschrift for Richard Muller" alt="Festschrift for Richard Muller" src="https://dash.dedeo.tk/wp-content/uploads/Muller_Festschrift.jpg" width="195" height="297" /></a></p>
<p>On 9 October 2013 Calvin Seminary <a href="http://calvinseminary.edu/2013/10/11/phd-celebration-2013/">celebrated the twentieth year</a> of its esteemed PhD program. <a href="http://calvinseminary.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/PhD-Celebration-Booklet-9-2013.pdf">The celebration’s program</a> included Dr. James De Jong’s brief retrospective on the original vision for the PhD program and how it was established. Prof. Richard Muller delivered the plenary address, “Reflections on Two Decades of the Ph.D. Program,” after which his former students and colleagues presented him <a href="http://www.juniusinstitute.org/blog/muller-festschrift-presented-at-cts-phd-anniversary-celebration/">a surprise, massive festschrift</a> overflowing with no less than 55 contributions: <em><a href="http://www.brill.com/products/book/church-and-school-early-modern-protestantism">Church and School in Early Modern Protestantism: Studies in Honor of Richard A. Muller on the Maturation of a Theological Tradition</a> </em>(Leiden: Brill, 2013).</p>
<p>After <a href="http://vimeo.com/76708215">watching the presentations</a> I am even more grateful to the Lord for granting me—no doubt the least of the cadre of scholarly sojourners seeking the office of doctor with which to serve the church—a place in this program at this time in its existence and with these teachers.</p>
<div class="embed-vimeo" style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/76708215" width="525" height="295" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>It is clear from the presentations that that the program was designed with specific ends in mind: to attract students from all over the world, to maintain a high academic standard with an emphasis on research and writing, and to specialize in Reformed catholic theology. And it is also clear that, twenty years into the program, a legacy of attaining the desired ends has been established—no doubt due to the two decades of hard work and wise leadership of the program’s leaders, Professors Feenstra and Muller, coupled with full support from the first-class faculty and library. There is much here for which God may be glorified for his abundant mercy and grace upon the program and upon its leaders.</p>
<p>The results of the program speak for themselves—literally! Her graduates are teachers, writers, professors, and institutional leaders in stations all over the globe. Even in the minute back corner of Christ’s garden in which he has planted me, the NAPARC world, the influence of CTS PhDs looms large both in numbers of teachers taking up stations in NAPARC seminaries and in the ever-growing body of top-tier publications, especially in the field of Reformed historical theology, flowing from the pens of CTS PhD’s.</p>
<p>To give a handful of cases in point (cf. <a href="http://libguides.calvin.edu/content.php?pid=16333&amp;sid=402455">the archive of downloadable CTS dissertations</a>):</p>

Ballor, <a href="http://www.v-r.de/en/title-2-2/covenant_causality_and_law-1008125/"><em>Covenant, Causality, and Law: A Study in the Theology of Wolfgang Musculus</em></a>, Refo500 Academic Studies (Göttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 2012). See also Dr. Ballor’s <em><a href="http://www.getyourhandsdirtybook.com/">Get Your Hands Dirty</a></em> and editorship of the <a href="http://www.marketsandmorality.com/index.php/mandm"><em>Journal of Markets &amp; Morality</em></a>.</li>

Mark Beach, <a href="http://www.v-r.de/en/title-2-2/christ_and_the_covenant-1002320/"><em>Christ and the Covenant: Francis Turretin’s Federal Theology as a Defense of the Doctrine of Grace</em></a>, Reformed Historical Theology 1 (Göttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 2007). See also Dr. Beach’s editorship of the <a href="http://www.midamerica.edu/resources/journal.htm"><em>Mid-America Journal of Theology</em></a>.</li>
<li>William Ames, <a href="http://www.heritagebooks.org/a-sketch-of-the-christians-catechism-classic-reformed-theology-series/"><em>A Sketch of the Christian’s Catechism</em></a>, trans by. Todd M. Rester, Classic Reformed Theology 1 (Grand Rapids, MI: Reformation Heritage Books, 2008). See also Rester’s translation of Petrus van Mastricht, <a href="http://www.heritagebooks.org/the-best-method-of-preaching/"><em>The Best Method of Preaching</em></a> (Grand Rapids, MI: Reformation Heritage Books, 2013), a foretaste of Rester’s forthcoming multi-volume translation of Mastricht’s <em>Theoretico-practica Theologia</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>As one who is halfway through the program and who has hit no small amount of speed bumps along the way (even some large ones such as “The Awful German Language,” as Mark Twain put it) I can testify to the program’s rigor. This is even more true following the transition from the trimester system to the semester system according to which students now write <em>three</em> twenty-five-page papers each term. But more importantly I can testify to the program’s wisdom. Though the means are painful (let me tell you, three papers per term for four terms plus course reading, assistant teaching, foreign languages, etc., was no walk in the park either for me or my family), the ends are starting to come into view.</p>
<p>I am different now than when I started the program three years ago. I care about bigger (catholic) issues. I am owning up to my own background with its limitations and prejudices. I’m learning, albeit ever so slowly, to read different languages (and hence to outgrow my monolingual, Anglophone narrowness), and I am learning to read differently (critically) in my own language. I write differently—with concrete aims and genre-appropriate methods. I teach differently—focusing on primary sources and fostering critical thinking. In these ways I see the program beginning to bear fruits in my life, and for that I give thanks to God.</p>
<p>While I stare down the still long, windy way to the PhD marathon’s finish line, it is an encouragement to be reminded along the way not only that the sowing in tears is designed to yield harvests of joy in due time but also that over the past two decades the Lord God has manifestly blessed this program with exceptional teachers whose living epistles are blessing Christ’s bride all over the world.</p>

<p>In this essay I present the state of the art concerning digital tools for Bavinck studies. I wrote this primarily for two groups of Bavinck scholars: first, the ever-growing number of non-European and non-American readers who might not have immediate access to digital media developed primarily in the West; second, the scholar for whom digital media is not his or her forte but who wishes nevertheless to know what sort of tools are currently available. Additionally, I hope that these reflections spur further development both in software development and in academic institutional development related to Bavinck studies. I suggest that the Bavinck Institute (or, as other have suggested, worldwide Bavinck Institutes) might benefit from modeling its digitization efforts after similar initiatives such as the <a href="http://kuyper.ptsem.edu/">Kuyper Digital Library</a> and the <a href="http://www.ccel.org/">CCEL</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-84" alt="Old Princeton — Princeton Seminary in the 1800s" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Princeton_Theological_Seminary-300x211.jpg" width="300" height="211" />In the NAPARC world what the oude schrijvers (old writers) are to the Dutch brethren, the Old Princeton professors are to the American Presbyterians: indefatigable cedars of Lebanon among soft saplings bending in the breeze, North Stars amid fading comets, deep wells of perennial piety and wisdom.</p>
<p>Yet one aspect of the esteemed Old Princeton writers that is often overlooked by admirers—one that seems contradictory to their reputation of standing tall for strict orthodoxy against the manifold heterodoxies and heresies of their day—is that they actually favored theological <em>progress</em>. They did not merely beat the retreat to “dead” scholasticism with their heads in the academic sand or find satisfaction for their hearts with mere repristinations of bygone Protestant orthodoxy; rather, they candidly engaged the academic fray of the day, and they sought to advance theology just as practitioners of all other sciences seek to play their parts in advancing their fields.</p>
<p>For instance, as much as people poke fun at Hodge’s claim to have taught no new idea at Princeton during his tenure (a claim, BTW, that is not unlike Francis Turretin’s remark in the preface to his <em>Elenctic </em>about his relation to the Genevan Academy), Hodge insisted on going off to Germany to hear the incipient German higher criticism first hand. In the words of William Buell Sprague’s (1795–1876) <a href="http://archive.org/stream/discourseaddress15spra#page/42/mode/2up">discourse delivered at Princeton Seminary’s fiftieth anniversary</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The influence of this seminary, I remark again, has been a conservative, and yet not an unduly restrictive, influence—it has been adverse to a reckless spirit of innovation, but favourable to healthful progress. (p. 43)</p></blockquote>
<p>The Princetonians favored progress. But they did so prudently: they distinguished the true freedom of “healthful progress”—liberty under divine law as pursued as sons of light—from the odious, cheap imitation of liberty—autonomy—that often masquerades under the banner of “academic freedom” yet leads to blindness and slavery to lesser lights. Again, in Sprague’s words:</p>
<blockquote><p>The tendency to extremes is one of the qualities that mark the imperfection, not to say perverseness, of our common humanity; but never, perhaps, has this tendency manifested itself so palpably, or in so great a variety of forms, as since this seminary has been in existence; and hence, to meet the exigency hereby created, we have the new and expressive word, <em>ultraism</em>. (pp. 43–44)</p></blockquote>
<p>This “ultraism,” writes Sprague, is  not outright opposition to truth but an imbalanced perspective that</p>
<blockquote><p>always contemplates, originally, a good object—it always has its basis in truth and right; but, from being exclusively or disproportionately contemplated by an ill-balanced mind, the object either acquires an undue relative importance, or else it suggests the use of unjustifiable means for its accomplishment. (p. 44)</p></blockquote>
<p>Though Sprague had in mind a particular issue of his day (i.e., the fanaticism that became rampant in certain forms of revivalism; see p. 44), deep within this definition resonates a tone of <em>balance</em> that can, with due prudence, be fruitfully applied to contemporary American Reformed theology of the NAPARC variety. For an elder—starting with his own heart—will likely face “ultraism” a thousand times more frequently than he will confront outright heresy. And among our theologians one wonders whether many—if not most—of the intramural debates that divide us, that we nit pick, or even slander each other about, have more to do with imbalance than heterodoxy: pondering good objects in such a way that favors one aspect of the object’s truth to the exclusion of other equally valid if not equally important aspects; or pursuing a valid scriptural end with invalid or partially invalid means.</p>
<p>Many specific intramural debates might be considered in this light. For instance, whether biblical theology—particularly the BT of the Vos-Ridderbos-Kline variety (though you know, BTW, that there are two Ridderbosses, father and son, right?)—has been overemphasized in the last few decades to the detriment of Reformed dogmatics. Likewise, larger-picture issues are worthy of considering on the scale of balance such as whether the nearly complete absence of engagement with classical metaphysics in our philosophical and theological discourse has brought enrichment or deprivation to our pursuit of supreme wisdom, that humble viewing of all things in God’s light and God’s light in all things; and consequently whether our reflection on topics such as political theology, social ethics, and atheism seems less than captivating, persuasive, or powerful.</p>
<p>Whether or not these particular issues are worthy of reflection, one thing is true: achieving balance in theology despite our human tendency to imbalance—our hearts, after all, are idol factories, said Calvin—is certainly not easy. But if the Old Princetonians are right, there will be no true theological progress in our churches and seminaries without it. And seeing this is perhaps one of the best reasons for spending time with the old writers.</p>
