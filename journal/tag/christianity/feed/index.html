								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-170" alt="J. P. Torrell" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Torrell.jpg" width="216" height="274" />Jean-Pierre Torrell notes that many know Thomas the intellectual but not Thomas the mystic. In this way “his intellectual renown is partly misleading,” he insists. And when one passes from hearsay to actually meeting Friar Thomas’s handiwork firsthand, continues Torrell, one finds the body and soul of a pastor beneath the Dominican’s habit:</p>
<blockquote><p>The figure who at times seems to be known only for his philosophy is also first and foremost a theologian, a commentator on Sacred Scripture, an attentive student of the Fathers of the church, and a man concerned about the spiritual and pastoral repercussions of his teaching. His disciples know this well and have long labored to facilitate access to their Master’s secret garden.</p></blockquote>
<p>—Preface to <em>Saint Thomas Aquinas</em>, vol. 2, <em>Spiritual Master</em>, trans. Robert Royal<br />
(Washington D.C.: The Catholic University of America Press, 2003).</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For me this year has ushered in a season of change: new job, new city, new house, new puppies (yes, that&#8217;s a <em>plural</em>—thanks to G-pa O!—with all of the double-trouble craziness entailed [literally!] therein). The new job brought with it an unexpected need for a new dynamic cloud-based web server (long story, and yes, those of us who were teens during the rise of 5MB AOL homepages are all insufferable webmaster-geeks deep down). Hence the time is right to bid adieu to my trusty but dated adware-supported blog of the past several years—<a title="Visit my old blog" href="http://inthylight.wordpress.com">In Thy Light</a>—and to start afresh on “my own” ad-free corner of the cloud. Hence <em>de Deo</em>.</p>
<p>The new name (which derives from the heart of classical dogmatics: the <em>locus de Deo</em>) signals an admittedly counter-cultural note: until we humbly submit our hearts and minds to the very being which our naturalistic, materialistic, atheistic, nihilistic, idealist, restless age tells us is impossible, unreal, unnecessary, irrational, idiotic, and prudish, our hearts will remain in restless bondage to loves lesser than Love itself, and our minds will shackled to truths lesser than Truth itself.</p>
<p>It is my growing conviction that classical Christian wisdom as found in the Reformed catholic tradition offers much light for contemporary reflection upon philosophical and theological issues. Thus in accord with <a href="http://www.esvbible.org/Psalm+36%3A9/">Psalm 36:9</a> I aim to inculcate in myself and in my readers a catholic sensibility: a deep appreciation for the great, universally-acclaimed Christian teachers of the past, not merely to parrot them but to follow in their footsteps as free and skillful apprentices in Wisdom’s court who ponder all things in light of their first and final cause and thereby find true rest for heart and mind in God.</p>
<p>The simpler, sleeker, and responsive look facilitates ongoing reflection with a new audience and all of their new web-savvy devices: my students, both past and present. For the topics I teach I will endeavor to keep you updated on what I&#8217;m reading, reflections on relevant current events, and the like.</p>
<p>Though the web, perhaps more than other mediums, lends itself to pandering to imprudence (<a href="http://www.esvbible.org/Proverbs+10%3A19/">Prov. 10:19</a>), my prayer is that, by grace, my journal will be a boon to prudent reflection upon God in all things and all things in God.</p>
