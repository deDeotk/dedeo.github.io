<p>In Msgr. Wippel’s <a href="http://maritain.nd.edu/ama/Vocation/Vocation301.pdf">survey</a> of the three essential features for a philosophy that is both consonant with Holy Scripture and fit for answering the modern crisis of meaning (i.e., meaninglessness inherent with technological advance that pretends to dismiss ultimate truth), metaphysics, that science of the most fundamental human wisdom, takes center stage. And the main act is reappropriating a definition of truth that is <em>actually true</em>—the kind of “truth” that means that that which is true <em>really is; </em>and consequently that that which is true for one is, must be, and cannot be otherwise than true for all—if indeed it is true:</p>
<blockquote><p>This in turn leads to a second requirement for such a philosophy, the Pope continues, and one which he has already mentioned, namely that it support the human intellect&#8217;s ability to know the truth of things themselves, that is, to arrive at objective truth or, as the Pope also puts it, at the very essence of objects of knowledge (<em>ad essentiam ipsam obiectorum cognitionis</em>) “by means of that <em>adaequatio rei et intellectus</em> to which Scholastic Doctors referred” (#82). In a note, the Pope explicitly refers to Thomas&#8217;s <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1016.htm"><em>ST</em> I, 16.1</a>, and to Bonaventure&#8217;s <em>Collationes in Hexaemeron</em>, Collatio 111.24. Here, therefore, the Pope is calling for a robust philosophical realism.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right; font-size: .7em;">—Msgr. John F. Wippel, “<a href="http://maritain.nd.edu/ama/Vocation/Vocation301.pdf"><em>Fides et Ratio’s</em> Call for a Renewal of Metaphysics and St. Thomas Aquinas</a>,” in <em><a href="http://maritain.nd.edu/ama/Vocation/">The Vocation of the Catholic Philosopher</a>: From Maritain to John Paul II</em>, ed. John P. Hittinger (Washington, DC: Catholic University of America Press, 2010), 160.</p>
<p>These are <a href="/journal/the-presocratic-are-always-with-us/">warring words</a>, for sure, as are all assertions of objective truth. Yet for those who dare search for “truth” that is both larger than their own minds and rooted in reality—not to mention for Christians who in humble faith take the “all things” in <a href="http://www.esvbible.org/Romans%2011.36/">Rom. 11:36</a> seriously—they lead to the kind of fight that’s worth having and is in fact is unavoidable in the present evil age. At the very least they should give us pause to consider what definition of “truth” is guiding our own pilgrimage through life’s short, vapor-like veil of tears.</p>

<blockquote><p>The life of the real is not entirely in what we see, in what we can analyze by knowledge. The real has a hidden life, like Jesus, and this life also is a life in God; it is, as it were, a life of God; it is a revelation of His wisdom in laws, of His power in effects, of His goodness in the usefulness of things, of His tendency to diffuse Himself in exchange and growth; it is a kind of incarnation which we must venerate and love, keeping in contact with Him who thus embodies Himself. To separate this ‘body of God’ from His Spirit is to abuse it; just as it is an abuse of Christ to see in Him the man only.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Everything that instructs us leads us to God on a hidden byway. Every authentic truth is in itself eternal, and its quality of eternity turns u stowards the eternity of which it is the revelation. Through nature and the soul, where can we go if not towards their origin? If one does not get there, it is because one has gone off the path. At one bound the inspired and right mind goes beyond intermediaries, and to every question that arises within it, whatever particular answers it may make, a secret voice says: God!</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>[D]efending natural law and natural theology requires revitalizing the entire classical metaphysical tradition and attacking the metaphysical assumptions of modern philosophy at their core.</p></blockquote>
<p>And second:</p>
<blockquote><p>We “old” natural law theorists, meanwhile, do appeal to “inherent purposes” and “nature’s forms.”  We agree with Hart that natural law theory requires such a classical metaphysical foundation.  But precisely for that reason, we are also well aware that that entails that we are committed to a radically different conception of nature from that of modern secularists, and that “any ‘natural’ terms [we] employ have very different meanings for [those] interlocutors” (as Hart tells us — as if it were news).  We realize that we cannot take for granted a common metaphysical understanding of the natural world and proceed directly to moral arguments, but have first to challenge the moderns’ understanding of nature itself, and that this is a Herculean project.</p></blockquote>
<p>—Dr. Edward Feser, “<a href="http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2013/07/hart-stopping.html">Hart stopping</a>”</p>
<p>I highlight this classically Roman Catholic assumption not to enter into the Hart-Feser debate on natural law in <em>First Things</em> and elsewhere (Feser links to the salvos in the first paragraph of his “<a href="http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2013/07/hart-stopping.html">Hart stopping</a>”) but to pause for a brief reflection on the interrelation of natural law and metaphysics in natural law discussions in the NAPARC world: is this same philosophical assumption valid and necessary in Protestant natural law theory?</p>
<p>A few pointed sub-questions lend themselves to further reflection on this point:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can the Reformed tradition revitalize its natural law heritage without “revitalizing the entire classical metaphysical tradition”?</li>
<li>Can the Reformed tradition continue to castigate, ignore, or otherwise downplay the other correlate of natural law besides the much-discussed <em>duplex regnum—</em>natural theology—and at the same time recover natural law theory?</li>
<li>Would Reformed theologians—who would readily affirm a “radically different conception of nature from that of modern secularists”—also affirm that “that natural law theory requires . . . a classical metaphysical foundation”?</li>
<li>Are Reformed theologians content to deduce an entire theory of natural law from scriptural proof texts such as Romans 2:14–15, or would they affirm the need “first to challenge the moderns’ understanding of nature itself” and second “that this is a Herculean project”?</li>
<li>Supposing that the parties in the NAPARC discussions of natural law (whether proponents or opponents) affirm “that this is a Herculean project,” would they hold that this is a philosophical or a theological project? To use the older language: which science in the encyclopedia of the sciences would they task with tackling this project?</li>
</ul>
