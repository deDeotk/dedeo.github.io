<p>In Msgr. Wippel’s <a href="http://maritain.nd.edu/ama/Vocation/Vocation301.pdf">survey</a> of the three essential features for a philosophy that is both consonant with Holy Scripture and fit for answering the modern crisis of meaning (i.e., meaninglessness inherent with technological advance that pretends to dismiss ultimate truth), metaphysics, that science of the most fundamental human wisdom, takes center stage. And the main act is reappropriating a definition of truth that is <em>actually true</em>—the kind of “truth” that means that that which is true <em>really is; </em>and consequently that that which is true for one is, must be, and cannot be otherwise than true for all—if indeed it is true:</p>
<blockquote><p>This in turn leads to a second requirement for such a philosophy, the Pope continues, and one which he has already mentioned, namely that it support the human intellect&#8217;s ability to know the truth of things themselves, that is, to arrive at objective truth or, as the Pope also puts it, at the very essence of objects of knowledge (<em>ad essentiam ipsam obiectorum cognitionis</em>) “by means of that <em>adaequatio rei et intellectus</em> to which Scholastic Doctors referred” (#82). In a note, the Pope explicitly refers to Thomas&#8217;s <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1016.htm"><em>ST</em> I, 16.1</a>, and to Bonaventure&#8217;s <em>Collationes in Hexaemeron</em>, Collatio 111.24. Here, therefore, the Pope is calling for a robust philosophical realism.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right; font-size: .7em;">—Msgr. John F. Wippel, “<a href="http://maritain.nd.edu/ama/Vocation/Vocation301.pdf"><em>Fides et Ratio’s</em> Call for a Renewal of Metaphysics and St. Thomas Aquinas</a>,” in <em><a href="http://maritain.nd.edu/ama/Vocation/">The Vocation of the Catholic Philosopher</a>: From Maritain to John Paul II</em>, ed. John P. Hittinger (Washington, DC: Catholic University of America Press, 2010), 160.</p>
<p>These are <a href="/journal/the-presocratic-are-always-with-us/">warring words</a>, for sure, as are all assertions of objective truth. Yet for those who dare search for “truth” that is both larger than their own minds and rooted in reality—not to mention for Christians who in humble faith take the “all things” in <a href="http://www.esvbible.org/Romans%2011.36/">Rom. 11:36</a> seriously—they lead to the kind of fight that’s worth having and is in fact is unavoidable in the present evil age. At the very least they should give us pause to consider what definition of “truth” is guiding our own pilgrimage through life’s short, vapor-like veil of tears.</p>

<blockquote><p>The life of the real is not entirely in what we see, in what we can analyze by knowledge. The real has a hidden life, like Jesus, and this life also is a life in God; it is, as it were, a life of God; it is a revelation of His wisdom in laws, of His power in effects, of His goodness in the usefulness of things, of His tendency to diffuse Himself in exchange and growth; it is a kind of incarnation which we must venerate and love, keeping in contact with Him who thus embodies Himself. To separate this ‘body of God’ from His Spirit is to abuse it; just as it is an abuse of Christ to see in Him the man only.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Everything that instructs us leads us to God on a hidden byway. Every authentic truth is in itself eternal, and its quality of eternity turns u stowards the eternity of which it is the revelation. Through nature and the soul, where can we go if not towards their origin? If one does not get there, it is because one has gone off the path. At one bound the inspired and right mind goes beyond intermediaries, and to every question that arises within it, whatever particular answers it may make, a secret voice says: God!</p></blockquote>

<p>In the first chapter of his <a href="http://udallas.edu/news/2013/31st-annual-aquinas-lecture-to-feature-professor-john-boyle.html">2013 Aquinas Lecture</a> at the University of Dallas (published as <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BwLDngEACAAJ"><em>Master Thomas Aquinas and the Fulness of Life</em></a>), Professor John Boyle makes a simple observation about the stark Medieval-modern shift in understanding of the nature of theology as a science that I find profound and worthy of a brief self-reflection and expansion; namely, that the modern drive for encyclopedic knowledge (i.e., fields of knowledge literally organized alphabetically; that is, by an <em>extrinsic</em> organizing principle that has no organic relation to the body of knowledge itself) indicates not simply a change in the quantity of knowledge (the explosion of scientific knowledge in the modern period and a corresponding need to find a quick and handy way to organize all the new knowledge) but more radically and more importantly a change in the quality or nature of scientific knowledge: from wisdom to cataloguing, generalization to specialization, knowledge according to causes (pl.) to knowledge according to cause (sg., usually efficient cause alone).</p>
<p>The medieval period was an age of <em>summae</em>, notes Boyle, precisely because it was widely held that the educated person was not a cataloguer of data but a seeker of wisdom, one who strives to see the order that exists within a body of knowledge according to the principles inherent in that body—according to its <em>intrinsic</em> organizing principles—and then draws out the implications and relations of those principles for that field of knowledge. The seeker of wisdom also sees her own field of knowledge as itself related to a larger order of causation, a First Mover, an ultimate end and highest good from which all being and knowledge derive and to which they proceed. Fittingly, Boyle points to the wise man in the first chapter of Aquinas’ <em>Summa contra Gentiles</em> as an example par excellence.</p>
<p><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BwLDngEACAAJ"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-905" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Boyle_MasterThomas.jpeg" alt="Master Thomas Aquinas and the Fullness of Life by John f. Boyle" width="128" height="199" /></a>To expand the medieval-modern-shift idea beyond Boyle’s lecture to include the present Internet age poses a contrast of the same genus albeit not of the exact same species: the internet-based (or the mathematical [i.e., the algorithmic, search engine-based]) organizing principle of knowledge is similar to the alphabetic-based principle insofar as both are extrinsic to the body of knowledge itself. And expanding our gaze in this way, it seems to me, leaves us with the same problem today with the mathematical approach as with the earlier alphabetic approach: for all the growth in human access to data and quantity of data, we fail to see a corresponding growth in wisdom, the ordering of knowledge to a final, perfect purpose beyond that knowledge itself.</p>
<p>I’m generalizing egregiously here, I know. Yet if I failed to state the obvious—albeit the hard to quantify obvious&#8230;how does one measure wisdom or the lack thereof?—I fear I would be deceiving myself equally as egregiously about the warp and woof of the present age and the current attitude toward scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>If I make a final quick turn to consider my own humble field of study—sacra doctrina—I might venture to say thinking about how one proceeds to order theological material (i.e., what extrinsic or intrinsic principles are at play) seems to hold promise, at the very least, for figuring out which theological movements are out of balance and mere fads (i.e., ordered mostly by extrinsic principles) and which are rooted in the perennial, intrinsic principles inherent, rooted deep down, in supernatural revelation and held in balance without one part, principle, or nuance dominating the richness of the whole.</p>
<p>Whether or not theology (or any other field of knowledge for that matter) will see another age of <em>summae</em>-making or the revival of fourfold causality, the ordering of knowledge to wisdom, and the like, pursuing this elusive end in theological science—or at the very least reminding the church that such wisdom is an important, several-centuries-long chapter in her story—might just be one of theology’s most precious gifts she can give to the church in her contemporary administration of the covenant of grace as teacher of sacred doctrine.</p>
