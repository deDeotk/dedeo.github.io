<blockquote><p>
  In the greater part of these recent works on St. Thomas Auinas one notes a preference for the analytic method. To be sure, this method had its merits. It was necessary to call attention to the theses, the theories, the several parts of the system, just as when seeking to make a person known, we begin by describing his life with its most noteworthy facts and salient exploits, as well as its most minute episodes and many seemingly negligible details. Every point of the Thomistic conception is scrutinized, illumined, discussed. After the manner of hardy explorers, the students of St. Thomas, in their loving solicitude to trace its lines with due precision, have not overlooked a single outskirt of this hallowed ground.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Olgiati then proceeds to describe the synthetic method of which his trenchant <em>Key</em> elucidates as a case in point:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Hitherto, however, the synthetic method has not received the attention it deserves. It would seem that after the painstaking and valuable researches along the way of analysis, not enough stress has been laid on pointing out to the men of our age the wonderful unity of the whole system. Frequently, even in otherwise eminent and learned works, the manifold doctrines engross the reader’s attention without making him feel the beauty and vibration of the one and only spirit that breathes life into the whole. So it happens that many, especially among its opponents, imagine they have understood Thomism, [all] the while as a matter of fact the <em>soul</em> of St. Thomas eludes their grasp. (pp. iv–v)
</p></blockquote>
<p>The power of the sapiential approach is not in its manifold distinctions but in its striving toward synthesis; to the analytic “he who distinguishes well learns well” must be added the synthetic “distinguish to unite” if one is to penetrate “the wonderful unity of the whole system.”</p>
<p>Why? The metaphysician moves from the appearances of things to their essences, from <em>ens</em> to <em>ratio entis</em>, from participated beings to First Being, from effects to First (and Final) Cause.<sup id="fnref-1333-2"><a href="#fn-1333-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> The theologian moves from the <em>logoi</em> of Holy Scripture to the <em>Logos</em>, from revelation deposited to revelation cogitated, from tenets of faith scattered to a body of divinity. Both perform unitive cognitive acts, referring all things to their chief and highest ends. Rarely is one person gifted with the extraordinary grace, genius, and wisdom required to perform both unitive acts in a preeminent degree. Such is the case with the <em>doctor communis</em>.</p>
<p>And such is the case too in its own way with the neo-Calvinist lights such as Kuyper and Bavinck and their intellectual forebearers, the Reformed orthodox doctors, as is slowly being recognized in contemporary Reformed Protestantism. To speculate for a minute in this digression, if someone ventured a similar synthetic study either of Bavinck’s <em>Dogmatiek</em> in particular or of Reformed dogmatics in general, I wonder whether the answer to “What is the Key?” would be similar to Olgiati’s answer with respect to Thomas.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, it seems desirable that we scholars in the field of systematic theology would every now and then take leave of the unending stream of analytic studies and pose to ourselves the synthetic questions lest we be found mistaking parts of the body for the soul, or, what might be worse, forgetting that there is a soul in our field to be found.</p>
<p>Along this line the outline of Bavinck&#8217;s <em>Dogmatics</em> provides a small opportunity to apply a synthetic <em>formalgegenstand</em> and to taste the “wonderful unity.”</p>
