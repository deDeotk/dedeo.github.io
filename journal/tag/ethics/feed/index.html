<p>The metaphysician, faced with someone who denies the first principles, or even with the task of judging the first principles, does no more than call to our attention the more searching eye already present in us all — merely reaches back more searchingly than does the ethician to what we all know. And, in that perspective, the first principles stand exposed as an intelligible hierarchy, a sequence of visions each flowing from its intelligible predecessor; and in that vision, “good” derives from “a being,” or, if one will, “ought” from “is.”</p></blockquote>

It is impossible. Either we are rational spirit obliged for ever to obey the absolute values of the <em>Tao</em>, or else we are mere nature to be kneaded and cut into new shapes for the pleasures of masters who must, by hypothesis, have no motive but their own “natural” impulses. Only the <em>Tao</em> provides a common human law of action which can over-arch rulers and ruled alike. A dogmatic belief in objective value is necessary to the very idea of a rule which is not tyranny or an obedience which is not slavery.</p></blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Giovanni_Andrea_de_Ferrari_-_%27Joseph%27s_Coat_Brought_to_Jacob%27,_oil_on_canvas,_c._1640,_El_Paso_Museum_of_Art.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-421" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; border: 1px solid black;" title="Giovanni Andrea de Ferrari — Joseph's Coat brought to Jacob" alt="Giovanni Andrea de Ferrari — Joseph's Coat brought to Jacob" src="https://dash.dedeo.tk/wp-content/uploads/Giovanni_Andrea_de_Ferrari—Josephs_Coat.jpg" width="279" height="240" /></a></p>
<p>Recently I preached on what at first glance seems like a throw-away line in the climactic reunion scene of the Joseph story: “do not quarrel on the way.” This is the last thing that Joseph says to his brothers before he sends them back to Canaan for the <em>second</em> time, and it only makes sense if you put it in the context of the dramatic transition from murderous hatred in the opening scenes to reconciliation and brotherly love in the climax.</p>
<p>Despite its brevity and enigmatic character, I find the importance of this command—both for Joseph’s brothers and for contemporary life—to lie in its relation to the sixth commandment. Consider, for instance, how the Larger Catechism explains the duties and prohibitions of this commandment in line with Jesus’s teaching on anger in Matthew 5.</p>
<blockquote><p>Q. 134. Which is the sixth commandment?<br />
A. The sixth commandment is, Thou shalt not kill.</p>
<p>Q. 135. What are the duties required in the sixth commandment?<br />
A. The duties required in the sixth commandment are, all careful studies, and lawful endeavors, to preserve the life of ourselves and others by resisting all thoughts and purposes, subduing all passions, and avoiding all occasions, temptations, and practices, which tend to the unjust taking away the life of any; by just defense thereof against violence, patient bearing of the hand of God, quietness of mind, cheerfulness of spirit; a sober use of meat, drink, physic, sleep, labor, and recreations; by charitable thoughts, love, compassion, meekness, gentleness, kindness; peaceable, mild and courteous speeches and behavior; forbearance, readiness to be reconciled, patient bearing and forgiving of injuries, and requiting good for evil; comforting and succoring the distressed, and protecting and defending the innocent.</p>
<p>Q. 136. What are the sins forbidden in the sixth commandment?<br />
A. The sins forbidden in the sixth commandment are, all taking away the life of ourselves, or of others, except in case of public justice, lawful war, or necessary defense; the neglecting or withdrawing the lawful and necessary means of preservation of life; sinful anger, hatred, envy, desire of revenge; all excessive passions, distracting cares; immoderate use of meat, drink, labor, and recreations; provoking words, oppression, quarreling, striking, wounding, and whatsoever else tends to the destruction of the life of any.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is likely no message needed more in our quarrelsome and bloodthirsty times—both within and without the church—than demanding brotherly unity as a means of fostering human flourishing. And there is likely no moral imperative that blatantly reveals our moral failures as humans and clearly shows us our need for the Father’s love, Christ’s mediation, and the Holy Spirit’s powerful indwelling than that which Joseph commands his brothers.</p>

<p>In this essay I present the state of the art concerning digital tools for Bavinck studies. I wrote this primarily for two groups of Bavinck scholars: first, the ever-growing number of non-European and non-American readers who might not have immediate access to digital media developed primarily in the West; second, the scholar for whom digital media is not his or her forte but who wishes nevertheless to know what sort of tools are currently available. Additionally, I hope that these reflections spur further development both in software development and in academic institutional development related to Bavinck studies. I suggest that the Bavinck Institute (or, as other have suggested, worldwide Bavinck Institutes) might benefit from modeling its digitization efforts after similar initiatives such as the <a href="http://kuyper.ptsem.edu">Kuyper Digital Library</a> and the <a href="http://www.ccel.org/">CCEL</a>.</p>
