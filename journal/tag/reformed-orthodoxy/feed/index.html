  . . . it is imperative for Christians to reaffirm their conviction that God has made the world objectively meaningful and purposeful and that he made human beings capable of discovering this meaning and purpose, despite their sinful propensity to distort what they discover. This, it seems to me, gets to the heart of what, historically, Christian natural law theory is all about.</p>
<p>  Natural law, in other words, is not first and foremost a means for making moral or apologetic arguments to which unbelievers will be compelled to give assent, but a means by which Christians express their conviction that God has made this universe in such a manner that there is a morally appropriate way for human beings to live within it, and that, furthermore, the moral law God has explicitly revealed in Scripture is not arbitrary but a reflection of this created reality. The Reformed community’s recent suspicion of natural law theory, I fear, has weakened its theological ability to affirm these things in a coherent and powerful way.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan-Baptist_Jozef_Walgrave">J. H. Walgrave</a>, “<a href="https://books.google.be/books?id=Ld-1VEnerwsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=nl&amp;pg=PA181#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">The Use of Philosophy in the Theology of Thomas Aquinas</a>,” in <i>Aquinas and Problems of His Time</i>, ed. G. Verbeke and D. Verhelst, Mediaevalia Lovaniensia 1 (The Hague: Leuven University Press, 1976), 181–93.</strong></p>
<p>Walgrave’s concise and sound explanation of Thomas Aquinas’s view on how <em>theologia sacrae scripturae</em> relates to <em>theologia philosophica</em>, or more broadly faith to reason, grace to nature, is well worth the perusal. Walgrave focuses his attention on the first of these couplets, elucidating several key passages and principles at play in Aquinas’s thought on this perennial question. More can be said on each of these couplets,<sup id="fnref-1309-1"><a href="#fn-1309-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> but not less, if, that is, one is to accurately represent the rudiments of Thomas’s position.</p>
<p>To venture a brief historical digression where a lowly American Presbyterian dares to tread on the theology-philosophy-relation question, the patient Protestant reader who is willing to set aside one’s twentieth-century Barthian, Dutch Reformed, Modern Protestant, or otherwise “Christomonistic,” “antithetical,” “anti-scholastic,” and “anti-Hellenization” preconceptions and read Thomas afresh for oneself might be surprised to find not a rationalist, dualistic enemy who, to borrow Walgrave’s phrases, everywhere reduces theology <em>sub metis philosophiae</em> but a champion of faith’s preeminence, a friend of Holy Scripture’s supreme authority, who everywhere reduces philosophy <em>ad metas fidei</em>.</p>
<p>And, to digress further, if one’s Protestant patience were to extend far enough to proceed from perusing the corpus Thomisticum on this perennial question to the 16th- and 17-century Reformed confessional and dogmatic writings on the same, one might be surprised again to find the rudiments of the Thomistic formulations reappearing not infrequently in the writings of the sharpest theological minds within Reformed orthodoxy.</p>
<p>Yet even apart from possible connections into Protestant ressourcement questions, Walgrave’s essay is a worthy companion to the first question in <em>ST</em> and to a fundamental theme in Aquinas’s thought.</p>
