<p><a href="http://www.prdl.org/author_view.php?a_id=405"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-139" alt="Rev Thomas Manton" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/RevThomasManton-245x300.jpg" width="245" height="300" /></a>Much of theology is discerning proper relations. All men live in relation to God, but not everyone relates to God the same way. Hence the three monotheisms, for instance, can be distinguished according to how they draw the relation between God and man: Lord and servant or Father and son; covenant of works or covenant of grace; unmediated or mediated.</p>
<p>Thomas Manton’s <a href="http://archive.org/stream/practi00mant#page/n239/mode/2up">observation on James 1:27</a> highlights the world of difference it is to call upon God not only as Lord but also as Abba, Father—a distinct privilege of Christian monotheism:</p>
<blockquote><p>We serve God most comfortably when we consider him as a Father in Christ. Lord, Lord<em>, is not half so sweet as </em>Our Father<em>. Duty in the covenant of grace is far more comfortable, not only as we have more help, but because it is done in a sweeter relation. We are not servants, but have received the adoption of sons. Get an interest in God, that his work may be sweet to you. Mercies yield the more sweetness when they come not only from a Creator, but a Father; and duties are done with the more confidence when we can come into the presence of God, not as servants, but sons. A servant may use greater industry and pains than a son, and yet please less.</em></p></blockquote>
