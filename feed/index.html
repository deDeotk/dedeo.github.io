<p>. . . sin, by virtue of its nature, always has a quality of unreasonableness and arbitrariness about it. When someone has sinned, he always tries to excuse or justify himself, but in this he never succeeds. There is never a reasonable basis or ground for sin. Its existence is and remains always lawlessness. True, some in our time try to maintain that the misdoer is brought to his sinful act by circumstances or by his disposition, but such internal or external inevitability is in one&#8217;s own conscience always subjected to overwhelming contradiction. Neither rationally nor psychologically is sin to be traced back to a disposition or action which has any reason or right to exist.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Nothing is good outside of faith. Brothers, those who abound in good works and are ignorant of the God of piety are like&nbsp;(to use a figure of speech) the remains of corpses, which, though clothed in beautiful things, don’t perceive the beautiful things. For what is the advantage of a dead soul, dead to the word of God, but clothed with good works? Works occur in the hope of compensation and crowns. But if you are ignorant of the judge, what do you contend for? Faith mustn’t be stripped of good works in order that it not be insulted; but faith is higher than works. For just as humans ought to especially esteem being alive, so too being nourished (for that which maintains our life is nourishment). In this way, our hope in Christ ought to be most important in our life, but also be nourished with good works.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First, a few theses from Johannes Maccovius’s <em>Theological and Philosophical Distinctions and Rules</em>, ch. 1, On Holy Scripture:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  XXXVIII. The object of theology and the object of philosophy are diverse and distinct.</p>
<p>  XXXIX. Truth never runs counter to (pugno) truth.</p>
<p>  XL. Sound reason and theology do not conflict (pugno).<sup id="fnref-1495-1"><a href="#fn-1495-1" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Second, a thesis from Gisbertus Voetius’s Thersites, self-tormentor:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I. The light of nature does not fight with (pugno) the light of grace, nor philosophy with theology. Therefore, a-theological, and also doing injury to God and His truth, are those who condemn philosophy.<sup id="fnref-1495-2"><a href="#fn-1495-2" class="jetpack-footnote">2</a></sup>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Third, a summation from Herman Bavinck’s <em>Reformed Dogmatics</em>, which employs the “non pugno” motif in Bavinck’s European narrative style:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  If theology thus has its internal principle not in faith as such but in believing reflection, the task of reason in theological science calls for further definition. In this context we must first of all and fundamentally reject the notion that regards faith and reason as two independent powers engaging in a life-and-death struggle with each other. . . . Faith, the faith by which we believe (de fides qua creditur), is not an organ or faculty next to or above reason but a disposition or habit of reason itself. . . . Faith, therefore, does not relieve Christians of the desire to study and reflect; rather it spurs them on to the end. Nature is not destroyed by regeneration but restored.</p>
<p>  Believers who want to devote themselves to the study of theology, accordingly, must prepare their minds for the task awaiting them. There is no admission to the temple of theology except by way of the study of the arts. Indispensable to the practitioner of the science of theology is philosophical, historical, and linguistic preparatory training.<sup id="fnref-1495-3"><a href="#fn-1495-3" class="jetpack-footnote">3</a></sup>

  We do not say with Descartes: “Cogito, ergo sum,” . . . ; on the contrary, instead of basing ourselves immediately upon the operation which is proper to the highest of our faculties, we rest first of all and with great assurance in the experience of touching, in which we have at the same time an experience of existing. To be sure, this consciousness is not without thought, but it is a thought which depends upon touch and which does not as yet reveal itself as thought. It is the tangible qualities which are to us first principles of thought and action. If we had to venture an Aristotelian counterpart to Descartes’ “Cogito, ergo sum,” we would say without hesitation: “Sedeo, ergo sum”: I am sitting, therefore I am.
