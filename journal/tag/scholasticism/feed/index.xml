<p>In Msgr. Wippel’s <a href="http://maritain.nd.edu/ama/Vocation/Vocation301.pdf">survey</a> of the three essential features for a philosophy that is both consonant with Holy Scripture and fit for answering the modern crisis of meaning (i.e., meaninglessness inherent with technological advance that pretends to dismiss ultimate truth), metaphysics, that science of the most fundamental human wisdom, takes center stage. And the main act is reappropriating a definition of truth that is <em>actually true</em>—the kind of “truth” that means that that which is true <em>really is; </em>and consequently that that which is true for one is, must be, and cannot be otherwise than true for all—if indeed it is true:</p>
<blockquote><p>This in turn leads to a second requirement for such a philosophy, the Pope continues, and one which he has already mentioned, namely that it support the human intellect&#8217;s ability to know the truth of things themselves, that is, to arrive at objective truth or, as the Pope also puts it, at the very essence of objects of knowledge (<em>ad essentiam ipsam obiectorum cognitionis</em>) “by means of that <em>adaequatio rei et intellectus</em> to which Scholastic Doctors referred” (#82). In a note, the Pope explicitly refers to Thomas&#8217;s <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1016.htm"><em>ST</em> I, 16.1</a>, and to Bonaventure&#8217;s <em>Collationes in Hexaemeron</em>, Collatio 111.24. Here, therefore, the Pope is calling for a robust philosophical realism.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right; font-size: .7em;">—Msgr. John F. Wippel, “<a href="http://maritain.nd.edu/ama/Vocation/Vocation301.pdf"><em>Fides et Ratio’s</em> Call for a Renewal of Metaphysics and St. Thomas Aquinas</a>,” in <em><a href="http://maritain.nd.edu/ama/Vocation/">The Vocation of the Catholic Philosopher</a>: From Maritain to John Paul II</em>, ed. John P. Hittinger (Washington, DC: Catholic University of America Press, 2010), 160.</p>
<p>These are <a href="/journal/the-presocratic-are-always-with-us/">warring words</a>, for sure, as are all assertions of objective truth. Yet for those who dare search for “truth” that is both larger than their own minds and rooted in reality—not to mention for Christians who in humble faith take the “all things” in <a href="http://www.esvbible.org/Romans%2011.36/">Rom. 11:36</a> seriously—they lead to the kind of fight that’s worth having and is in fact is unavoidable in the present evil age. At the very least they should give us pause to consider what definition of “truth” is guiding our own pilgrimage through life’s short, vapor-like veil of tears.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>One of the attractions of Scholasticism is that it is at all not doctrinal, which is completely contrary to the false image that is still sometimes presented of medieval thought (though fortunately now tending to disappear). We cannot say that Scholastic philosophy ‘said’ this or that. Such a claim would make no sense. Scholastic philosophy always turns around a set of opposed theses: it is systematic <em>disputatio</em>. Rarely in the history of thought have philosophical theses been as diverse and as original as in Scholasticism: the contrast with our own time is particularly striking.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Too many theologians have turned their attention away from questions of objective, metaphysical truth to matters of aesthetics, or moral sentiment, or psychology, culture, or history.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 25px; margin-top: 0px;">. . . What Christian theology needs now more than ever is its traditional, Scholastic backbone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right;">—Dr. Edward Feser, “<a href="http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2013/05/neither-nature-alone-nor-grace-alone.html">Neither nature alone nor grace alone</a>”</p>
<p>The crying need in Roman Catholic theology finds an analog in contemporary Reformed catholicism. We Protestants used to know our Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, and Thomas as well as our Roman interlocutors. Moreover, we used to be concerned with the nature of reality, the nature of truth, and the unity of knowledge. Perhaps it is time for us, along with Rome, to steady our spines with some corrective surgery from the great doctors of the church. Where to begin?
