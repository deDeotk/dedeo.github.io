  . . . it is imperative for Christians to reaffirm their conviction that God has made the world objectively meaningful and purposeful and that he made human beings capable of discovering this meaning and purpose, despite their sinful propensity to distort what they discover. This, it seems to me, gets to the heart of what, historically, Christian natural law theory is all about.</p>
<p>  Natural law, in other words, is not first and foremost a means for making moral or apologetic arguments to which unbelievers will be compelled to give assent, but a means by which Christians express their conviction that God has made this universe in such a manner that there is a morally appropriate way for human beings to live within it, and that, furthermore, the moral law God has explicitly revealed in Scripture is not arbitrary but a reflection of this created reality. The Reformed community’s recent suspicion of natural law theory, I fear, has weakened its theological ability to affirm these things in a coherent and powerful way.

<p>The metaphysician, faced with someone who denies the first principles, or even with the task of judging the first principles, does no more than call to our attention the more searching eye already present in us all — merely reaches back more searchingly than does the ethician to what we all know.

<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>But one cannot recalibrate a baloney-meter that receives continuous interfering signals from another installed alongside it. The ersatz baloney-meter implanted by modern education cannot be calibrated at all. It lights up and beeps at the very mention of an objective moral law. “Aren’t we beyond all that now?” “Aren’t morals just relative?” “Aren’t good and evil up to the individual?”</p>
<p>In the classroom I answer such questions, “Tell that to the man who is trying to rape or murder you.” This is a much more aggressive response than Aristotle and Thomas would make to their students, but their students did not ask such questions. Today a classical teacher must be aggressive before he can exercise his humility. Before the students’ original baloney-meters can be recalibrated, the ersatz baloney-meters that have been installed alongside them must be disconnected. So students must unlearn before they can learn. A classical teacher today is first, though not last, an unteacher.</p></blockquote>
