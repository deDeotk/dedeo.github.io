The rich constellation of mathematical essences may beguile the philosopher—Descartes turned physics into geometry, for example. The realm of logic, the inner, stable universe of beings of reason, may also offer itself as a better and neater world than the untidy realm of change and contingence. But a truly realist philosophy will always guard against this temptation to spin reality out of its own substance; it will always refer its abstractions back to their existential source, constantly renewing and refreshing itself at the inexhaustible fount of existence itself.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The life of the real is not entirely in what we see, in what we can analyze by knowledge. The real has a hidden life, like Jesus, and this life also is a life in God; it is, as it were, a life of God; it is a revelation of His wisdom in laws, of His power in effects, of His goodness in the usefulness of things, of His tendency to diffuse Himself in exchange and growth; it is a kind of incarnation which we must venerate and love, keeping in contact with Him who thus embodies Himself. To separate this ‘body of God’ from His Spirit is to abuse it; just as it is an abuse of Christ to see in Him the man only.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Everything that instructs us leads us to God on a hidden byway. Every authentic truth is in itself eternal, and its quality of eternity turns u stowards the eternity of which it is the revelation. Through nature and the soul, where can we go if not towards their origin? If one does not get there, it is because one has gone off the path. At one bound the inspired and right mind goes beyond intermediaries, and to every question that arises within it, whatever particular answers it may make, a secret voice says: God!</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>By nature we are all realists, including, in practice, the idealists themselves. Actually idealism is something—an opinion belonging to a school—directly contrary to life and experience. It does not explain how and why every human automatically and spontaneously gets to ascribing objectivity and independent reality to the things perceived, instead of viewing them purely as inner states of consciousness. At the same time we clearly distinguish between internal states and external things, between that which is in us and that which is outside of us, between dream (hallucination) and reality. Add to this that man is never, in any area, autonomous but everywhere and always dependent on the nature surrounding him. By his body he is bound to the earth. Shelter, food, and clothing come to him from the earth; it would be strange if intellectually things were different. Just as with our own hands we prepare food and clothing while nevertheless deriving the materials for them from nature outside of us, so with our intellect we also receive the material from without. Here, too, the intellect is an instrument, not a source. Idealism equates the organ of knowledge with the source of knowledge, as it were making the eye into the source of light, deducing the thought from the process of thinking. However, this is not possible because a thing and the representation of a thing, being and thinking, to be and to perceive, are distinct and cannot be equated. These two, after all, are totally different in kind.</p></blockquote>
