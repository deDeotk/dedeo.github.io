								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.davenanttrust.org/news/bringing-a-language-back-from-the-dead-the-davenant-latin-institute/"><img class="alignright wp-image-963 size-medium" style="border: 1px solid black;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/DavenantLatinInstitute-e1428515963103-300x163.jpg" alt="Davenant Latin Institute" width="300" height="163" /></a>There is an unforgettably realistic line in the “<a href="http://www.corpusthomisticum.org/wintroen.html">Brief [English] Introduction</a>” to the <a href="http://www.corpusthomisticum.org/">Corpus Thomisticum</a>: “We choose Latin as the main language of the Corpus Thomisticum, for every student of Thomas can read his original texts, which are in Latin indeed.”</p>
<p>The validity and soundness of the deduction implicit here—if I can’t read Latin, etc.—can be appreciated to a limited extent by the non-Latinist through studying the works of the true students who do in fact base their work directly on the Corpus. There is an undeniable richness, profundity, and nuance that speaks for itself in writers such as Gilson, DeKoninck, Boyle, Garrigou-Lagrange, Torrell, to name but a few. Nevertheless, that unforgettably realistic norm, that true measure remains for the non-Latinist. It is a given, a prerequisite in the field. And when it is absent the want of richness, profundity, and nuance also speaks for itself.</p>
<p>If there were in existence an analogous “Brief Introduction” to the <a href="http://www.prdl.org/">Post-Reformation Digital Library</a>, which in its own way might fairly be termed a sort of functional Protestant equivalent to the Corpus Thomisticum, I think the content would be virtually identical both in brevity and in realism: “Let he who would walk this virtual way take heed, the works found herein are Latin indeed.”</p>
<p>One simply cannot dig into the treasure trove of theological and philosophical works that is Protestant Orthodoxy without the linguistic key that unlocks the treasure chest. A wise man <a href="http://www.davenanttrust.org/latin-institute/the-task-of-translation/">puts his finger on</a> what ensues in our churches, educational institutions, and societies when we (ministers and Protestant educators) let this historical treasure remain locked up:</p>
<blockquote><p>But in our time, the forgetting of classical language arts in favor of a universalizing media discourse has affected the churches as much as it has affected the wider commonwealth. We have become too reliant on manuals which bottleneck the broad tradition on the one hand and unmoored speculation on the other. This is true of learning in general now, and certainly true of theological learning.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yours truly—whose Latin in truth lies more <em>in potentia</em> than <em>in actu</em>—cares about the want of Latin in his own educational background not merely—not even mostly—for the impersonal and general reasons stated above but personally and specifically. Look, it&#8217;s no joke. Take it from someone who has spent and is spending much time studying with some of the masters in the field—if you can’t read Latin works, your ability to study classical Reformed theology will be severely limited in scope, mostly second-hand, and ever at risk of inadvertent inaccuracy and imprecise assessment; for so few of the major works in this period are available in accurate anglophone translations. And even then, the scholar whose work is solely based on translations will no doubt be forced to yield to the scholar whose work is based on originals. It&#8217;s just how things work.</p>
<p>As I work concretely on owning up to this reality for myself, I hope as part of your path forward I’ll find you in class with me at the inaugural <a href="http://www.davenanttrust.org/latin-institute/">Davenant Latin Institute</a>, which aims step by step to bring a bit of the Protestant treasure chest <a href="http://www.davenanttrust.org/news/bringing-a-language-back-from-the-dead-the-davenant-latin-institute/">back from the dead</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>The Davenant Latin Institute aims to equip today’s seminarians, graduate students, and teachers with the competency to unearth these treasures, reading them in the original and perhaps even translating them for others to enjoy. We will be offering a program of online courses, both introductory and advanced, equipping students with basic Latin reading competence and, for those that desire, the skills they need to engage with and translate some of the most difficult early modern theological texts.</p></blockquote>
