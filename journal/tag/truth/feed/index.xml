<p>In Msgr. Wippel’s <a href="http://maritain.nd.edu/ama/Vocation/Vocation301.pdf">survey</a> of the three essential features for a philosophy that is both consonant with Holy Scripture and fit for answering the modern crisis of meaning (i.e., meaninglessness inherent with technological advance that pretends to dismiss ultimate truth), metaphysics, that science of the most fundamental human wisdom, takes center stage. And the main act is reappropriating a definition of truth that is <em>actually true</em>—the kind of “truth” that means that that which is true <em>really is; </em>and consequently that that which is true for one is, must be, and cannot be otherwise than true for all—if indeed it is true:</p>
<blockquote><p>This in turn leads to a second requirement for such a philosophy, the Pope continues, and one which he has already mentioned, namely that it support the human intellect&#8217;s ability to know the truth of things themselves, that is, to arrive at objective truth or, as the Pope also puts it, at the very essence of objects of knowledge (<em>ad essentiam ipsam obiectorum cognitionis</em>) “by means of that <em>adaequatio rei et intellectus</em> to which Scholastic Doctors referred” (#82). In a note, the Pope explicitly refers to Thomas&#8217;s <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1016.htm"><em>ST</em> I, 16.1</a>, and to Bonaventure&#8217;s <em>Collationes in Hexaemeron</em>, Collatio 111.24. Here, therefore, the Pope is calling for a robust philosophical realism.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right; font-size: .7em;">—Msgr. John F. Wippel, “<a href="http://maritain.nd.edu/ama/Vocation/Vocation301.pdf"><em>Fides et Ratio’s</em> Call for a Renewal of Metaphysics and St. Thomas Aquinas</a>,” in <em><a href="http://maritain.nd.edu/ama/Vocation/">The Vocation of the Catholic Philosopher</a>: From Maritain to John Paul II</em>, ed. John P. Hittinger (Washington, DC: Catholic University of America Press, 2010), 160.</p>
<p>These are <a href="/journal/the-presocratic-are-always-with-us/">warring words</a>, for sure, as are all assertions of objective truth. Yet for those who dare search for “truth” that is both larger than their own minds and rooted in reality—not to mention for Christians who in humble faith take the “all things” in <a href="http://www.esvbible.org/Romans%2011.36/">Rom. 11:36</a> seriously—they lead to the kind of fight that’s worth having and is in fact is unavoidable in the present evil age. At the very least they should give us pause to consider what definition of “truth” is guiding our own pilgrimage through life’s short, vapor-like veil of tears.</p>

<blockquote><p>The life of the real is not entirely in what we see, in what we can analyze by knowledge. The real has a hidden life, like Jesus, and this life also is a life in God; it is, as it were, a life of God; it is a revelation of His wisdom in laws, of His power in effects, of His goodness in the usefulness of things, of His tendency to diffuse Himself in exchange and growth; it is a kind of incarnation which we must venerate and love, keeping in contact with Him who thus embodies Himself. To separate this ‘body of God’ from His Spirit is to abuse it; just as it is an abuse of Christ to see in Him the man only.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Everything that instructs us leads us to God on a hidden byway. Every authentic truth is in itself eternal, and its quality of eternity turns u stowards the eternity of which it is the revelation. Through nature and the soul, where can we go if not towards their origin? If one does not get there, it is because one has gone off the path. At one bound the inspired and right mind goes beyond intermediaries, and to every question that arises within it, whatever particular answers it may make, a secret voice says: God!</p></blockquote>
