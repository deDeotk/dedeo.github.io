It does mean that I believe he was one of the greatest systematic minds the christian church has ever had, and that I can see a lot farther standing on his shoulders than by attacking him in the back. No, I do not agree with everything he ever wrote. On the other hand, neither do I agree with everything <em>I</em> ever wrote. But seven hundred years from now no one will even recognize my name, while Aquinas’s works will still be used with great profit.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 2014 rendition of Ravi Zacharias International Ministries’ Summit on Islam is a one-day seminar in Atlanta on January 11th: “<a href="http://www.rzim.org/events/?trumbaEmbed=view%3Devent%26eventid%3D108059081">Understanding and Answering Islam</a>.” Having attended <a href="http://www.rzim.org/events/#/?i=13">last year’s Summit</a> in Orlando, I can say that, if you are looking for a thoughtful, entry-level introduction to American Evangelical thought on Islam, this will be a great event for you to get your toes wet in the ocean of Islam.</p>
<p>If you already have your toes in the water—e.g., you have already starting frequenting your local mosque and have initiated friendships with local Muslims—you might want to invest in a more advanced seminar such as the annual <a href="http://dearbornlegacyconference.org/">Dearborn Legacy Conference</a>.</p>

F. Mikhail’s</a> recent dissertation at the University of Birmingham on a forgotten ninth-century Christian theologian who lived in an Islamic context: <a href="http://etheses.bham.ac.uk/4162/">‘Ammār al-Baṣrī’s <em>Kitāb al-Burhān</em>: a topical and theological analysis of Arabic Christian theology in the ninth century</a> (<a href="http://etheses.bham.ac.uk/4162/1/Mikhail13PhD.pdf">PDF</a>; 445 pp.; 2 MB). This welcome study includes the first English translation of ‘Ammār’s <em>Kitāb al-Burhān</em>.</p>
<p>In class last fall I tried to emphasize the need for us Western Christians to listen to and learn from our Eastern adelphoi with respect to Christian-Muslim relations. Mikhail’s study looks to be an important and much useful tool for this purpose. Along this line de Wit asks, in reference to ‘Ammār’s Christian musing on Islam: “could it be that, at least in some respects, the Arabs are centuries ahead of Europeans and Americans?” I hope we Western Evangelicals are ready with a quick “yes!”</p>
