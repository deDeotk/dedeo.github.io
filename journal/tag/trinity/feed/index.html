All men live in relation to God, but not everyone relates to God the same way. Hence the three monotheisms, for instance, can be distinguished according to how they draw the relation between God and man: Lord and servant or Father and son; covenant of works or covenant of grace; unmediated or mediated.</p>
<p>Thomas Manton’s <a href="http://archive.org/stream/practi00mant#page/n239/mode/2up">observation on James 1:27</a> highlights the world of difference it is to call upon God not only as Lord but also as Abba, Father—a distinct privilege of Christian monotheism:</p>
<blockquote><p>We serve God most comfortably when we consider him as a Father in Christ. Lord, Lord<em>, is not half so sweet as </em>Our Father<em>. Duty in the covenant of grace is far more comfortable, not only as we have more help, but because it is done in a sweeter relation. We are not servants, but have received the adoption of sons. Get an interest in God, that his work may be sweet to you. Mercies yield the more sweetness when they come not only from a Creator, but a Father; and duties are done with the more confidence when we can come into the presence of God, not as servants, but sons. A servant may use greater industry and pains than a son, and yet please less.</em></p></blockquote>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-170" alt="J. P. Torrell" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Torrell.jpg" width="216" height="274" />Jean-Pierre Torrell comments on Aquinas’s prolegomena to his commentary on Lombard’s <em>Sentences</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>If we do not remember the biblical affirmation of God as the Alpha and Omega of all that is visible and invisible, this plan may seem only a rather flat assertion. We do not perceive all its depth until we grasp the organizing <em>ratio</em> that gives it its intelligibility. Thomas sees the <em>ratio</em><em> </em>in the fact that the creation—the emergence of creatures from God, the first principle—finds its explanation in the fact that even in God there is an “emergence of the principle,” which is the procession of the Word from the Father. The divine efficacy that works in the creation is thus related to the generation of the Word, just as the formal cause of the grace that will permit creatures to return to God is linked to the spiration of the Holy Spirit. More precisely and fully, we might therefore say that the divine missions <em>ad extra</em> are explained according to the order of the processions of the divine persons <em>ad intra</em>.</p></blockquote>
