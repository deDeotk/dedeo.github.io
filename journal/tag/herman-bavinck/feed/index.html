<blockquote><p>
  In the greater part of these recent works on St. Thomas Auinas one notes a preference for the analytic method. To be sure, this method had its merits. It was necessary to call attention to the theses, the theories, the several parts of the system, just as when seeking to make a person known, we begin by describing his life with its most noteworthy facts and salient exploits, as well as its most minute episodes and many seemingly negligible details. Every point of the Thomistic conception is scrutinized, illumined, discussed. After the manner of hardy explorers, the students of St. Thomas, in their loving solicitude to trace its lines with due precision, have not overlooked a single outskirt of this hallowed ground.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Olgiati then proceeds to describe the synthetic method of which his trenchant <em>Key</em> elucidates as a case in point:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Hitherto, however, the synthetic method has not received the attention it deserves. It would seem that after the painstaking and valuable researches along the way of analysis, not enough stress has been laid on pointing out to the men of our age the wonderful unity of the whole system. Frequently, even in otherwise eminent and learned works, the manifold doctrines engross the reader’s attention without making him feel the beauty and vibration of the one and only spirit that breathes life into the whole. So it happens that many, especially among its opponents, imagine they have understood Thomism, [all] the while as a matter of fact the <em>soul</em> of St. Thomas eludes their grasp. (pp. iv–v)
</p></blockquote>
<p>The power of the sapiential approach is not in its manifold distinctions but in its striving toward synthesis; to the analytic “he who distinguishes well learns well” must be added the synthetic “distinguish to unite” if one is to penetrate “the wonderful unity of the whole system.”</p>
<p>Why? The metaphysician moves from the appearances of things to their essences, from <em>ens</em> to <em>ratio entis</em>, from participated beings to First Being, from effects to First (and Final) Cause.<sup id="fnref-1333-2"><a href="#fn-1333-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> The theologian moves from the <em>logoi</em> of Holy Scripture to the <em>Logos</em>, from revelation deposited to revelation cogitated, from tenets of faith scattered to a body of divinity. Both perform unitive cognitive acts, referring all things to their chief and highest ends. Rarely is one person gifted with the extraordinary grace, genius, and wisdom required to perform both unitive acts in a preeminent degree. Such is the case with the <em>doctor communis</em>.</p>
<p>And such is the case too in its own way with the neo-Calvinist lights such as Kuyper and Bavinck and their intellectual forebearers, the Reformed orthodox doctors, as is slowly being recognized in contemporary Reformed Protestantism. To speculate for a minute in this digression, if someone ventured a similar synthetic study either of Bavinck’s <em>Dogmatiek</em> in particular or of Reformed dogmatics in general, I wonder whether the answer to “What is the Key?” would be similar to Olgiati’s answer with respect to Thomas.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, it seems desirable that we scholars in the field of systematic theology would every now and then take leave of the unending stream of analytic studies and pose to ourselves the synthetic questions lest we be found mistaking parts of the body for the soul, or, what might be worse, forgetting that there is a soul in our field to be found.</p>
<p>Along this line the outline of Bavinck&#8217;s <em>Dogmatics</em> provides a small opportunity to apply a synthetic <em>formalgegenstand</em> and to taste the “wonderful unity.”</p>

<blockquote><p>By nature we are all realists, including, in practice, the idealists themselves. Actually idealism is something—an opinion belonging to a school—directly contrary to life and experience. It does not explain how and why every human automatically and spontaneously gets to ascribing objectivity and independent reality to the things perceived, instead of viewing them purely as inner states of consciousness. At the same time we clearly distinguish between internal states and external things, between that which is in us and that which is outside of us, between dream (hallucination) and reality. Add to this that man is never, in any area, autonomous but everywhere and always dependent on the nature surrounding him. By his body he is bound to the earth. Shelter, food, and clothing come to him from the earth; it would be strange if intellectually things were different. Just as with our own hands we prepare food and clothing while nevertheless deriving the materials for them from nature outside of us, so with our intellect we also receive the material from without. Here, too, the intellect is an instrument, not a source. Idealism equates the organ of knowledge with the source of knowledge, as it were making the eye into the source of light, deducing the thought from the process of thinking. However, this is not possible because a thing and the representation of a thing, being and thinking, to be and to perceive, are distinct and cannot be equated. These two, after all, are totally different in kind.</p></blockquote>

<p>The highlight of my previous two summers has been a long drive from Orlando to the North-and-South Carolina border in search of a rustic, middle-of-nowhere log cabin along with a boathouse on beautiful Lake Lanier. If you’re thinking, “Boom! Called it: a Wild at Heart retreat!” Close, but no cigar. It’s the annual Convivium Irenicum (formerly <a href="http://www.davenanttrust.org/projects/convivium-calvinisticum-2014/">Convivium Calvinisticum</a>).</p>
<p>While there are a bunch of dudes doing “wild” and “manly” deeds such as jumping out of windows, hiking perilous mountain trails, battling fiercely in the basement table tennis arena, and imbibing copious libations and whatnot), the cabin is primarily a temporary temple for heartfelt prayer and song and also a portico of Solomonic sorts for a sharpening of minds and a common pursuit of wisdom in the <a href="http://calvinistinternational.com/2012/03/18/truth-and-method/">Reformed catholic tradition of irenicism</a>.</p>
<p>What does this look like, practically? So far there have been keynote presentations from top-notch speakers (the first two were world-class professors: Torrance Kirby and James Bratt) along with copious time for formal and informal discussion. Additionally, several pastors and young scholars present papers and direct discussions. There is lots of debate. Lots of food. And lots of fellowship.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.davenanttrust.org/news/audio-from-2014-convivium-now-available-for-download/">presentations</a> from the 2014 Convivium <a href="http://www.davenanttrust.org/news/davenant-trust-unveils-our-first-publication-for-the-healing-of-the-nations/">have recently been published</a> in an excellent collection of essays: <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=zNBGBQAAQBA"><em>For the Healing of the Nations: Essays on Creation, Redemption, and Neo-Calvinism</em></a>, edited by W. Bradford Littlejohn and Peter Escalante (The Davenant Trust, 2014; <a href="https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zNBGBQAAQBAJ">Google Play</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/For-Healing-Nations-Redemption-Neo-Calvinism/dp/0692322183/">Amazon Kindle</a> e-books available).</p>
<p>The least of these is my contribution, “<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=zNBGBQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA139#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false">‘Bavinck’s bug’ or ‘Van Tilian’ Hypochondria?</a>: An Analysis of Prof. Oliphint’s Assertion that Cognitive Realism and Reformed Theology Are Incompatible,” in which I suggest a brief historical analysis of where the anti-scholastic critiques against realism come from and attempt a brief common sense analysis regarding why it might make sense to rethink both the later neo-Calvinist antipathy toward classical realism such as that found in Bavinck’s thought and the logical entailments of Dr. Van Til’s transcendental idealism. I’ve attached <a href="http://j.mp/convivium_intro">my introduction</a> (PDF; pre-published version).</p>

<p>In this essay I present the state of the art concerning digital tools for Bavinck studies. I wrote this primarily for two groups of Bavinck scholars: first, the ever-growing number of non-European and non-American readers who might not have immediate access to digital media developed primarily in the West; second, the scholar for whom digital media is not his or her forte but who wishes nevertheless to know what sort of tools are currently available. Additionally, I hope that these reflections spur further development both in software development and in academic institutional development related to Bavinck studies. I suggest that the Bavinck Institute (or, as other have suggested, worldwide Bavinck Institutes) might benefit from modeling its digitization efforts after similar initiatives such as the <a href="http://kuyper.ptsem.edu">Kuyper Digital Library</a> and the <a href="http://www.ccel.org/">CCEL</a>.</p>

<p>In this primarily historical essay I analyze Herman Bavinck’s (1854–1921) dogmatic formulation (or, more accurately, attempted <em>re</em>-formulation) of the <em>pactum salutis</em> or covenant of redemption in light of the allegation that Bavinck is to blame for subsequent, extreme, “ontologizing” formulations of the doctrine that arose among Dutch Reformed theologians after Bavinck. Based on an analysis of the dogmatic context and content of Bavinck’s formulation together with a survey of his usages of the doctrine, I argue that the allegation is unsound and invalid insofar as it ignores the standard Reformed orthodox trinitarian distinctions that Bavinck employs to distinguish God’s being per se from his work of redemption. In his thought the <em>pactum salutis</em> is the apex not of the former but of the latter.</p>
