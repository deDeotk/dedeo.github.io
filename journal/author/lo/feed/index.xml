				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First, a few theses from Johannes Maccovius’s <em>Theological and Philosophical Distinctions and Rules</em>, ch. 1, On Holy Scripture:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  XXXVIII. The object of theology and the object of philosophy are diverse and distinct.</p>
<p>  XXXIX. Truth never runs counter to (pugno) truth.</p>
<p>  XL. Sound reason and theology do not conflict (pugno).<sup id="fnref-1495-1"><a href="#fn-1495-1" class="jetpack-footnote">1</a></sup>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Second, a thesis from Gisbertus Voetius’s Thersites, self-tormentor:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I. The light of nature does not fight with (pugno) the light of grace, nor philosophy with theology. Therefore, a-theological, and also doing injury to God and His truth, are those who condemn philosophy.<sup id="fnref-1495-2"><a href="#fn-1495-2" class="jetpack-footnote">2</a></sup>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Third, a summation from Herman Bavinck’s <em>Reformed Dogmatics</em>, which employs the “non pugno” motif in Bavinck’s European narrative style:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  If theology thus has its internal principle not in faith as such but in believing reflection, the task of reason in theological science calls for further definition. In this context we must first of all and fundamentally reject the notion that regards faith and reason as two independent powers engaging in a life-and-death struggle with each other. . . . Faith, the faith by which we believe (de fides qua creditur), is not an organ or faculty next to or above reason but a disposition or habit of reason itself. . . . Faith, therefore, does not relieve Christians of the desire to study and reflect; rather it spurs them on to the end. Nature is not destroyed by regeneration but restored.</p>
<p>  Believers who want to devote themselves to the study of theology, accordingly, must prepare their minds for the task awaiting them. There is no admission to the temple of theology except by way of the study of the arts. Indispensable to the practitioner of the science of theology is philosophical, historical, and linguistic preparatory training.<sup id="fnref-1495-3"><a href="#fn-1495-3" class="jetpack-footnote">3</a></sup>

<p>Perhaps it is not far off to say that the health of one’s knowledge of the doctrine of the covenant is proportionate to an increase in such apropos prostrations before the Almighty and confessions of limitation.</p>
<p>Whether or not such a rule attains, this flavor of<em> theologia viatorum</em> is one to be desired.</p>

  We do not say with Descartes: “Cogito, ergo sum,” . . . ; on the contrary, instead of basing ourselves immediately upon the operation which is proper to the highest of our faculties, we rest first of all and with great assurance in the experience of touching, in which we have at the same time an experience of existing. To be sure, this consciousness is not without thought, but it is a thought which depends upon touch and which does not as yet reveal itself as thought. It is the tangible qualities which are to us first principles of thought and action. If we had to venture an Aristotelian counterpart to Descartes’ “Cogito, ergo sum,” we would say without hesitation: “Sedeo, ergo sum”: I am sitting, therefore I am.

<p>For whetting one’s appetite, several points in the conclusion of the “Theology and Philosophy” essay are worth considering in the American Reformed and Presbyterian orb. First and foremost:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Early modem Reformed thinkers did not spurn philosophy in itself. None of the different philosophical orientations articulated during the early modem period seems to have rejected philosophical or natural<br />
  theology as such. In this period there was no such phenomenon as, in the words of a prominent present-day Reformed philosopher, “The Reformed Objection to Natural Theology.” Modern Reformed conceptions, such as those of Barthian theology or of the school of reformational philosophy, differ starkly in their attitude towards natural theology from mainstream seventeenth-century Reformed theology. The latter&#8217;s largely positive reception of proofs for God’s existence clearly demonstrates its evidentialist orientation. <small>(pp. 61–62)</small>
</p></blockquote>
<p>He continues with an observation on the eclecticism of Reformed philosophy in the early modern era, an eclecticism that did not devolve into sheer pluralism and that maintained commitments to biblical authority and the unity of truth in the <em>duplex ordo cognitionis</em><sup id="fnref-1359-2"><a href="#fn-1359-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The philosophy that the Reformed adopted was not a single monolithic set of thoughts. Reformed thinkers philosophized in a number of different, sometimes diametrically opposed, ways. Quite a few were Ramists, many opted for an eclectic form of Christian Aristotelianism, while yet others supported Cartesian philosophy and attempted to articulate Reformed theology in terms of Cartesian concepts and presuppositions. Reformed doctrine was obviously taken to be compatible with a number of different philosophical approaches.</p>
<p>  This is not to say that all philosophical orientations were equally compatible with biblical Christianity. In some important respects, Aristotelian eclecticism was able to support biblical exegesis better than Cartesianism was—here one could think of its basic empirical orientation and of the form-matter concepts. The same seems to be true of the Aristotelians’ subordination of natural reason to theology in comparison to the strict separation between theology and philosophy advocated by some Cartesians. It could be argued that the latter separation contributed to a secularization of philosophy which, on the supposition of the unity of truth and its basic knowability, could only lead to an increasing antagonism between philosophy and theology. <small>(p. 62, paragraph break added)</small>
