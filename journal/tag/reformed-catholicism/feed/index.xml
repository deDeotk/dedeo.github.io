  O Almighty God, who has built thy Church upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone: Grant that by the operation of the Holy Ghost, all Christians may be so joined together in unity of Spirit, and in the bond of peace, that they may be an holy temple acceptable unto thee.</p>
<p>  . . . [G]ive the abundance of thy grace, that with one heart they may desire the prosperity of thy holy universal Church, and with one mouth may profess the faith once delivered to the saints. Defend them from the sins of heresy and schism; let not the foot of pride come night to hurt them, nor the hand of the ungodly to cast them down.</p>
<p>  And grant that the course of this world may be so peaceably ordered by thy governance, that thy Church may joyfully serve thee in all godly quietness: that so they may walk in the ways of truth and peace, and at last be numbered with thy saints in glory everlasting; through thy merits, O blessed Jesus, thou gracious Bishop and Shepherd of our souls, who art, with the Father and the Holy Ghost, one God, world without end. Amen.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.jtoddbillings.com/"><img class="alignright wp-image-633 size-thumbnail" style="border: 1px solid black;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Todd_Billings-150x150.jpg" alt="Prof. J. Todd Billings" width="150" height="150" /></a>Recently I came across <a href="http://www.jtoddbillings.com/">Prof. J. Todd Billings&#8217;s</a> thoughtful post on the Zondervan Academic blog: “<a href="http://zondervanacademic.com/blog/common-places-the-promise-and-prospects-of-retrieval-recent-developments-in-protestant-scholasticism/">The Promise and Prospects of Retrieval: Recent Developments in Protestant Scholasticism</a>.” Here Billings provides a brief survey of the academic waters in which my own student toes have been dipped—that strange and deep ocean of “Reformed scholasticism”—and suggests how this largely historical movement is positively influencing contemporary Reformed theology in North America. He sees the Reformed tradition in a light that I find to be eminently helpful and worthy of rediscovering; namely, being Reformed as a way of being the “one, holy catholic church” rather than being Reformed as an end in itself.</p>
<p>In passing Billings references his heartfelt essay “<a href="http://www.jtoddbillings.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Billings-Catholic-and-Reformed-Pro-Ecclesia1.pdf">Catholic and Reformed: Rediscovering a Tradition</a>,” <em>Pro Ecclesia</em> 23:2 (2014): 132–46, which sets forth a vision for Reformed catholicity in more depth vis-a-vis contemporary trends in Evangelical thought. Watch Billings deliver this essay in his inaugural lecture as Gordon H. Girod Research Professor of Reformed Theology at <a href="http://www.westernsem.edu/" target="_blank">Western Theological Seminary</a> in Holland, MI, below.</p>
