</ol>
<p>For whetting one’s appetite, several points in the conclusion of the “Theology and Philosophy” essay are worth considering in the American Reformed and Presbyterian orb. First and foremost:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Early modem Reformed thinkers did not spurn philosophy in itself. None of the different philosophical orientations articulated during the early modem period seems to have rejected philosophical or natural<br />
  theology as such. In this period there was no such phenomenon as, in the words of a prominent present-day Reformed philosopher, “The Reformed Objection to Natural Theology.” Modern Reformed conceptions, such as those of Barthian theology or of the school of reformational philosophy, differ starkly in their attitude towards natural theology from mainstream seventeenth-century Reformed theology. The latter&#8217;s largely positive reception of proofs for God’s existence clearly demonstrates its evidentialist orientation. <small>(pp. 61–62)</small>
</p></blockquote>
<p>He continues with an observation on the eclecticism of Reformed philosophy in the early modern era, an eclecticism that did not devolve into sheer pluralism and that maintained commitments to biblical authority and the unity of truth in the <em>duplex ordo cognitionis</em><sup id="fnref-1359-2"><a href="#fn-1359-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The philosophy that the Reformed adopted was not a single monolithic set of thoughts. Reformed thinkers philosophized in a number of different, sometimes diametrically opposed, ways. Quite a few were Ramists, many opted for an eclectic form of Christian Aristotelianism, while yet others supported Cartesian philosophy and attempted to articulate Reformed theology in terms of Cartesian concepts and presuppositions. Reformed doctrine was obviously taken to be compatible with a number of different philosophical approaches.</p>
<p>  This is not to say that all philosophical orientations were equally compatible with biblical Christianity. In some important respects, Aristotelian eclecticism was able to support biblical exegesis better than Cartesianism was—here one could think of its basic empirical orientation and of the form-matter concepts. The same seems to be true of the Aristotelians’ subordination of natural reason to theology in comparison to the strict separation between theology and philosophy advocated by some Cartesians. It could be argued that the latter separation contributed to a secularization of philosophy which, on the supposition of the unity of truth and its basic knowability, could only lead to an increasing antagonism between philosophy and theology. <small>(p. 62, paragraph break added)</small>

<p>In pursuing this end I have reached a Realistic Philosophy, opposed alike to the Sceptical Philosophy, which has proceeded from Hume, in England, and the Idealistic Philosophy, which has ramified from Kant, in Germany; while I have also departed from the Scottish and higher French Schools, as I hold resolutely that the mind, in its intelligent acts, begins with, and proceeds throughout, on a cognition of things.</p>
<p>If the mind does not assume and start with things, it can never reach realities by any process of reasoning or induction.</p></blockquote>
