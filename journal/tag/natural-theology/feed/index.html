</ol>
<p>For whetting one’s appetite, several points in the conclusion of the “Theology and Philosophy” essay are worth considering in the American Reformed and Presbyterian orb. First and foremost:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Early modem Reformed thinkers did not spurn philosophy in itself. None of the different philosophical orientations articulated during the early modem period seems to have rejected philosophical or natural<br />
  theology as such. In this period there was no such phenomenon as, in the words of a prominent present-day Reformed philosopher, “The Reformed Objection to Natural Theology.” Modern Reformed conceptions, such as those of Barthian theology or of the school of reformational philosophy, differ starkly in their attitude towards natural theology from mainstream seventeenth-century Reformed theology. The latter&#8217;s largely positive reception of proofs for God’s existence clearly demonstrates its evidentialist orientation. <small>(pp. 61–62)</small>
</p></blockquote>
<p>He continues with an observation on the eclecticism of Reformed philosophy in the early modern era, an eclecticism that did not devolve into sheer pluralism and that maintained commitments to biblical authority and the unity of truth in the <em>duplex ordo cognitionis</em><sup id="fnref-1359-2"><a href="#fn-1359-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The philosophy that the Reformed adopted was not a single monolithic set of thoughts. Reformed thinkers philosophized in a number of different, sometimes diametrically opposed, ways. Quite a few were Ramists, many opted for an eclectic form of Christian Aristotelianism, while yet others supported Cartesian philosophy and attempted to articulate Reformed theology in terms of Cartesian concepts and presuppositions. Reformed doctrine was obviously taken to be compatible with a number of different philosophical approaches.</p>
<p>  This is not to say that all philosophical orientations were equally compatible with biblical Christianity. In some important respects, Aristotelian eclecticism was able to support biblical exegesis better than Cartesianism was—here one could think of its basic empirical orientation and of the form-matter concepts. The same seems to be true of the Aristotelians’ subordination of natural reason to theology in comparison to the strict separation between theology and philosophy advocated by some Cartesians. It could be argued that the latter separation contributed to a secularization of philosophy which, on the supposition of the unity of truth and its basic knowability, could only lead to an increasing antagonism between philosophy and theology. <small>(p. 62, paragraph break added)</small>

<p>In thinking about the relation of faith and reason it is instructive to follow the brief rationale he gives in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=NjsQAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">the preface</a> for why a theologian like himself would venture to write a philosophical work. First, he gives biblical reasons to show that God himself in Holy Scripture has bestowed honor on humanity’s natural knowledge in many ways such as in God’s bringing the animals to Adam so that he would name them.</p>
<p>Second, he points to the “ancient Christian churches,” noting that church fathers from Clement to John of Damascus have “not denied unto the world their philosophical and poetical labours, either whole and alone, or mixed and directed to theological ends” (5).</p>
<p>Third, he notes notes that the Protestant doctors followed the same practice as the church fathers and medieval scholastics and produces a wide array of philosophical works:</p>
<blockquote><p>besides the schoolmen, and those vast labours of many of that side in dialectical, physical, and metaphysical writings, we might instance in very many of the reformed churches abroad, some of whose younger labours have seen the light: as also in the oratory, logical, moral, historical, mathematical, miscellaneous writings of many learned divines of our own church. . . . (6)</p></blockquote>
<p>Fourth, he gives his own terse walk down the well-worn path regarding the subordination of natural to supernatural knowledge, the necessity of natural knowledge for interpreting Holy Scripture, the spoils of Egypt motif found throughout the Old and New Testaments, and warnings regarding not the use but the misuse of philosophy. At one memorable point along this path Edwards remarks:</p>
<blockquote><p>when I consider that the spoils of Egypt were by God allowed to enrich Israel, and the spoils of the Gentiles reserved by David for the building of the temple; that a Gentile, by legal purification and marriage, might become an Israelite; that the crown of Rabbah was put upon the head of David, and the sword of Goliath used to slay himself; that the gold, and myrrh, and frankincense of the Wise men of the East, was offered unto the Christ; when I find the apostle convincing the Jews out of their law, and the philosophers out of their maxims; and every gift, as well as every creature of God, is good, and may be sanctified for the use and delight of man;  I then conclude with myself, that the moral and philosophical glass of the human soul may be of some service even unto the tabernacle, as the looking-glasses of the Israelitish women were unto the altar. (6–7)</p></blockquote>
<p>Both the method and content of the argument displayed in this brief preface—perhaps commonplace in its own time—is worthy of consideration and even emulation in our time, a time in which such wisdom and Reformed catholicity is not so common.</p>
