				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure id="attachment_902" style="max-width: 197px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://udallas.edu/news/2013/31st-annual-aquinas-lecture-to-feature-professor-john-boyle.html"><img class="size-medium wp-image-902" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/JohnFBoyle-197x300.jpg" alt="Prof. John F.

<p>In the first chapter of his <a href="http://udallas.edu/news/2013/31st-annual-aquinas-lecture-to-feature-professor-john-boyle.html">2013 Aquinas Lecture</a> at the University of Dallas (published as <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BwLDngEACAAJ"><em>Master Thomas Aquinas and the Fulness of Life</em></a>), Professor John Boyle makes a simple observation about the stark Medieval-modern shift in understanding of the nature of theology as a science that I find profound and worthy of a brief self-reflection and expansion; namely, that the modern drive for encyclopedic knowledge (i.e., fields of knowledge literally organized alphabetically; that is, by an <em>extrinsic</em> organizing principle that has no organic relation to the body of knowledge itself) indicates not simply a change in the quantity of knowledge (the explosion of scientific knowledge in the modern period and a corresponding need to find a quick and handy way to organize all the new knowledge) but more radically and more importantly a change in the quality or nature of scientific knowledge: from wisdom to cataloguing, generalization to specialization, knowledge according to causes (pl.) to knowledge according to cause (sg., usually efficient cause alone).</p>
<p>The medieval period was an age of <em>summae</em>, notes Boyle, precisely because it was widely held that the educated person was not a cataloguer of data but a seeker of wisdom, one who strives to see the order that exists within a body of knowledge according to the principles inherent in that body—according to its <em>intrinsic</em> organizing principles—and then draws out the implications and relations of those principles for that field of knowledge. The seeker of wisdom also sees her own field of knowledge as itself related to a larger order of causation, a First Mover, an ultimate end and highest good from which all being and knowledge derive and to which they proceed. Fittingly, Boyle points to the wise man in the first chapter of Aquinas’ <em>Summa contra Gentiles</em> as an example par excellence.</p>
<p><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BwLDngEACAAJ"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-905" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Boyle_MasterThomas.jpeg" alt="Master Thomas Aquinas and the Fullness of Life by John f. Boyle" width="128" height="199" /></a>To expand the medieval-modern-shift idea beyond Boyle’s lecture to include the present Internet age poses a contrast of the same genus albeit not of the exact same species: the internet-based (or the mathematical [i.e., the algorithmic, search engine-based]) organizing principle of knowledge is similar to the alphabetic-based principle insofar as both are extrinsic to the body of knowledge itself. And expanding our gaze in this way, it seems to me, leaves us with the same problem today with the mathematical approach as with the earlier alphabetic approach: for all the growth in human access to data and quantity of data, we fail to see a corresponding growth in wisdom, the ordering of knowledge to a final, perfect purpose beyond that knowledge itself.</p>
<p>I’m generalizing egregiously here, I know. Yet if I failed to state the obvious—albeit the hard to quantify obvious&#8230;how does one measure wisdom or the lack thereof?—I fear I would be deceiving myself equally as egregiously about the warp and woof of the present age and the current attitude toward scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>If I make a final quick turn to consider my own humble field of study—sacra doctrina—I might venture to say thinking about how one proceeds to order theological material (i.e., what extrinsic or intrinsic principles are at play) seems to hold promise, at the very least, for figuring out which theological movements are out of balance and mere fads (i.e., ordered mostly by extrinsic principles) and which are rooted in the perennial, intrinsic principles inherent, rooted deep down, in supernatural revelation and held in balance without one part, principle, or nuance dominating the richness of the whole.</p>
<p>Whether or not theology (or any other field of knowledge for that matter) will see another age of <em>summae</em>-making or the revival of fourfold causality, the ordering of knowledge to wisdom, and the like, pursuing this elusive end in theological science—or at the very least reminding the church that such wisdom is an important, several-centuries-long chapter in her story—might just be one of theology’s most precious gifts she can give to the church in her contemporary administration of the covenant of grace as teacher of sacred doctrine.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-84" alt="Old Princeton — Princeton Seminary in the 1800s" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Princeton_Theological_Seminary-300x211.jpg" width="300" height="211" />In the NAPARC world what the oude schrijvers (old writers) are to the Dutch brethren, the Old Princeton professors are to the American Presbyterians: indefatigable cedars of Lebanon among soft saplings bending in the breeze, North Stars amid fading comets, deep wells of perennial piety and wisdom.</p>
<p>Yet one aspect of the esteemed Old Princeton writers that is often overlooked by admirers—one that seems contradictory to their reputation of standing tall for strict orthodoxy against the manifold heterodoxies and heresies of their day—is that they actually favored theological <em>progress</em>. They did not merely beat the retreat to “dead” scholasticism with their heads in the academic sand or find satisfaction for their hearts with mere repristinations of bygone Protestant orthodoxy; rather, they candidly engaged the academic fray of the day, and they sought to advance theology just as practitioners of all other sciences seek to play their parts in advancing their fields.</p>
<p>For instance, as much as people poke fun at Hodge’s claim to have taught no new idea at Princeton during his tenure (a claim, BTW, that is not unlike Francis Turretin’s remark in the preface to his <em>Elenctic </em>about his relation to the Genevan Academy), Hodge insisted on going off to Germany to hear the incipient German higher criticism first hand. In the words of William Buell Sprague’s (1795–1876) <a href="http://archive.org/stream/discourseaddress15spra#page/42/mode/2up">discourse delivered at Princeton Seminary’s fiftieth anniversary</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The influence of this seminary, I remark again, has been a conservative, and yet not an unduly restrictive, influence—it has been adverse to a reckless spirit of innovation, but favourable to healthful progress. (p. 43)</p></blockquote>
<p>The Princetonians favored progress. But they did so prudently: they distinguished the true freedom of “healthful progress”—liberty under divine law as pursued as sons of light—from the odious, cheap imitation of liberty—autonomy—that often masquerades under the banner of “academic freedom” yet leads to blindness and slavery to lesser lights. Again, in Sprague’s words:</p>
<blockquote><p>The tendency to extremes is one of the qualities that mark the imperfection, not to say perverseness, of our common humanity; but never, perhaps, has this tendency manifested itself so palpably, or in so great a variety of forms, as since this seminary has been in existence; and hence, to meet the exigency hereby created, we have the new and expressive word, <em>ultraism</em>. (pp. 43–44)</p></blockquote>
<p>This “ultraism,” writes Sprague, is  not outright opposition to truth but an imbalanced perspective that</p>
<blockquote><p>always contemplates, originally, a good object—it always has its basis in truth and right; but, from being exclusively or disproportionately contemplated by an ill-balanced mind, the object either acquires an undue relative importance, or else it suggests the use of unjustifiable means for its accomplishment. (p. 44)</p></blockquote>
<p>Though Sprague had in mind a particular issue of his day (i.e., the fanaticism that became rampant in certain forms of revivalism; see p. 44), deep within this definition resonates a tone of <em>balance</em> that can, with due prudence, be fruitfully applied to contemporary American Reformed theology of the NAPARC variety. For an elder—starting with his own heart—will likely face “ultraism” a thousand times more frequently than he will confront outright heresy. And among our theologians one wonders whether many—if not most—of the intramural debates that divide us, that we nit pick, or even slander each other about, have more to do with imbalance than heterodoxy: pondering good objects in such a way that favors one aspect of the object’s truth to the exclusion of other equally valid if not equally important aspects; or pursuing a valid scriptural end with invalid or partially invalid means.</p>
<p>Many specific intramural debates might be considered in this light. For instance, whether biblical theology—particularly the BT of the Vos-Ridderbos-Kline variety (though you know, BTW, that there are two Ridderbosses, father and son, right?)—has been overemphasized in the last few decades to the detriment of Reformed dogmatics. Likewise, larger-picture issues are worthy of considering on the scale of balance such as whether the nearly complete absence of engagement with classical metaphysics in our philosophical and theological discourse has brought enrichment or deprivation to our pursuit of supreme wisdom, that humble viewing of all things in God’s light and God’s light in all things; and consequently whether our reflection on topics such as political theology, social ethics, and atheism seems less than captivating, persuasive, or powerful.</p>
<p>Whether or not these particular issues are worthy of reflection, one thing is true: achieving balance in theology despite our human tendency to imbalance—our hearts, after all, are idol factories, said Calvin—is certainly not easy. But if the Old Princetonians are right, there will be no true theological progress in our churches and seminaries without it. And seeing this is perhaps one of the best reasons for spending time with the old writers.</p>
