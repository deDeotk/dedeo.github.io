<blockquote><p>Again, the sight of God is twofold. One is perfect, whereby God&#8217;s Essence is seen: the other is imperfect, whereby, though we see not what God is, yet we see what He is not; and whereby, the more perfectly do we know God in this life, the more we understand that He surpasses all that the mind comprehends. Each of these visions of God belongs to the gift of understanding; the first, to the gift of understanding in its state of perfection, as possessed in heaven; the second, to the gift of understanding in its state of inchoation, as possessed by wayfarers.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right; font-size: .8em;">—Aquinas, <em>ST</em> <a href="http://dhspriory.org/thomas/summa/SS/SS008.html#SSQ8A7THEP1">2–2.8.7 corpus</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">God eludes the conception of our intellect because he transcends all that our mind conceives of him; but not so that our intellect is in no intelligible way likened to him.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is because human intelligence is not equal to the divine essence that this same divine essence surpasses our intelligence and is unknown to us: wherefore man reaches the highest point of his knowledge about God when he knows that he knows him not, inasmuch as he knows that that which is God transcends whatsoever he conceives of him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right; font-size: .8em;">—Aquinas, <em>De potentia</em> <a href="http://dhspriory.org/thomas/QDdePotentia7.htm#7:5">7.5 ad 13–14</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Whenever there is anything which corresponds to the concept we have of the word knowledge, of it we know not only that it is but also what it is, for knowledge is a distinct reality. But, as Damascene says, “we cannot know what God is, but only that He is.” Therefore, in God there is nothing corresponding to our concept expressed by knowledge. Knowledge, therefore, does not exist in God.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right; font-size: .8em;">—Aquinas, <em>De veritate</em> <a href="http://dhspriory.org/thomas/QDdeVer2.htm#1">2.1 ad 9</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>God as an unknown is said to be the terminus of our knowledge in the following respect: that the mind is found to be most perfectly in possession of knowledge of God when it is recognized that His essence is above everything that the mind is capable of apprehending in this life; and thus, although what He is remains unknown, yet it is known that He is.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right; font-size: .8em;">—Aquinas, <em>Expositio super librum Boethii De trinitate</em> <a href="http://www.dhspriory.org/thomas/BoethiusDeTr.htm#12">1.2 ad 1</a>.</p>
