								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan-Baptist_Jozef_Walgrave">J. H. Walgrave</a>, “<a href="https://books.google.be/books?id=Ld-1VEnerwsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=nl&amp;pg=PA181#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">The Use of Philosophy in the Theology of Thomas Aquinas</a>,” in <i>Aquinas and Problems of His Time</i>, ed. G. Verbeke and D. Verhelst, Mediaevalia Lovaniensia 1 (The Hague: Leuven University Press, 1976), 181–93.</strong></p>
<p>Walgrave’s concise and sound explanation of Thomas Aquinas’s view on how <em>theologia sacrae scripturae</em> relates to <em>theologia philosophica</em>, or more broadly faith to reason, grace to nature, is well worth the perusal. Walgrave focuses his attention on the first of these couplets, elucidating several key passages and principles at play in Aquinas’s thought on this perennial question. More can be said on each of these couplets,<sup id="fnref-1309-1"><a href="#fn-1309-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> but not less, if, that is, one is to accurately represent the rudiments of Thomas’s position.</p>
<p>To venture a brief historical digression where a lowly American Presbyterian dares to tread on the theology-philosophy-relation question, the patient Protestant reader who is willing to set aside one’s twentieth-century Barthian, Dutch Reformed, Modern Protestant, or otherwise “Christomonistic,” “antithetical,” “anti-scholastic,” and “anti-Hellenization” preconceptions and read Thomas afresh for oneself might be surprised to find not a rationalist, dualistic enemy who, to borrow Walgrave’s phrases, everywhere reduces theology <em>sub metis philosophiae</em> but a champion of faith’s preeminence, a friend of Holy Scripture’s supreme authority, who everywhere reduces philosophy <em>ad metas fidei</em>.</p>
<p>And, to digress further, if one’s Protestant patience were to extend far enough to proceed from perusing the corpus Thomisticum on this perennial question to the 16th- and 17-century Reformed confessional and dogmatic writings on the same, one might be surprised again to find the rudiments of the Thomistic formulations reappearing not infrequently in the writings of the sharpest theological minds within Reformed orthodoxy.</p>
<p>Yet even apart from possible connections into Protestant ressourcement questions, Walgrave’s essay is a worthy companion to the first question in <em>ST</em> and to a fundamental theme in Aquinas’s thought.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If mystery is the lifeblood of dogmatics (HT: Bavinck), it is because God is its very life and heart.</p>
<p>Thomas Aquinas well summarizes the classical teaching on the heart/object of theology:</p>
<blockquote><p>But sacred doctrine is chiefly concerned with God. . . .<sup>1</sup></p></blockquote>
<p>And again:</p>
<blockquote><p>. . . the chief aim of sacred doctrine is to teach the knowledge of God, not only as He is in Himself, but also as He is the beginning of things and their last end, and especially of rational creatures. . . .<sup>2</sup></p></blockquote>
<p>The Protestant doctors in the period of Reformed orthodoxy appropriated this catholic wisdom concerning the <em>locus de Deo. </em>For instance, Francis Turretin (1623–1687) writes concerning the object of sacred doctrine that:</p>
<blockquote><p>the more common and true opinion is that of those who refer it to God and divine things. . . . Thus that all things are discussed in theology either because they deal with God himself or have a relation (<em>schesin</em>) to him as the first principle and ultimate end.<sup>3</sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Additionally, the <a href="http://www.reformation21.org/articles/synopsis-purioris-theologiae.php">Leiden Synopsis</a> exclaims regarding the role of the locus de Deo in “most-sacred theology” that:</p>
<blockquote><p>God is treated not only as the principle upon which it is constructed and the source of our knowledge of it but also as the subject and the foremost, primary (<em>primus ac primarius</em>) <em>locus</em> of Theology from which all the others flow forth, by which they are held together, and to which they should be directed.<sup>4</sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Herman Bavinck (1854–1921), perhaps one of the last of the modern Protestant doctors who operated unapologetically within the tradition of Protestant orthodoxy, expresses this same commitment in the introduction to his treatment of the doctrine of God:</p>
<blockquote><p>In truth, the knowledge that God has revealed of himself in nature and Scripture far surpasses human imagination and understanding. In that sense it is all mystery with which the science of dogmatics is concerned, for it does not deal with finite creatures, but from beginning to end looks past all creatures and focuses on the eternal and infinite One himself. From the very start of its labors, it faces the incomprehensible One. From him it derives its inception, for from him are all things. But also in the remaining loci, when it turns its attention to creatures, it views them only in relation to God as they exist from him and through him and for him [Rom. 11:36].</p>
<p>So then, the knowledge of God is the only dogma, the exclusive content, of the entire field of dogmatics. All the doctrines treated in dogmatics—whether they concern the universe, humanity, Christ, and so forth—are but the explication of the one central dogma of the knowledge of God. All things are considered in light of God, subsumed under him, traced back to him as the starting point. Dogmatics is always called upon to ponder and describe God and God alone, whose glory is in creation and re-creation, in nature and grace, in the world and in the church. It is the knowledge of him alone that dogmatics must put on display.<sup>5</sup></p></blockquote>
<p>I dig the classical dictum concerning theology that flows out of this perennial teaching: theology is taught by God, teaches God, and leads to God. Yet my experience reveals a discouragingly high failure rate at keeping my eyes aimed on this end even, ironically, amidst the very act of post-graduate study <em>of theology</em>.</p>
<p>In listening to my own <em>theologoi</em> and those of others, I am forced to conclude that the more one’s theological discourse loses sight of its true object (which, BTW, is the ever-present danger, strong temptation, and intense gravity under which all seminary students and teachers labor in the present evil age), the less of the divine mystery one tastes at the Lord’s table, sees in the Lord’s Word, senses in the Lord’s house, finds in the communion of the saints, and expresses in well-ordered theological words whether printed on the page or spoken in the lectern. Without the beating heart, the lifeblood is cold, static, dead.</p>
<p>But to dig even deeper here, albeit too briefly, if I&#8217;m honest with myself I see in my heart—that chamber of the most intimate, private theological discourse—that when my eyes droop, when in my “theologizing” I replace the object of theology with lesser objects that at the time seemed for whatever foolish reason greater than The Only Object (things like proving my view of such and such superior to another’s or chasing one of the million rabbit trails to which my own curiosity leads or any other of the human vices that love to express themselves in academic study), my prayers either cease or hit the ceiling. They cease and/or they turn into meaningless platitudes: Lord help my kids, Lord give me this or that, blah blah. In these moments my “prayers” seem to become my conscience’s object lesson on the fact that the lifeblood has gone cold not only in my theology but in my heart.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is one of the reasons for the existence of re-orienting, gaze-lifting preparatory exercises such as the <a href="/journal/quotables/a-prayer-before-study/">student’s prayer</a>, preparation guidelines for Sabbath worship and communion given in the Reformed confessions, and the like. These humble things are wise prods for keeping theology’s main thing the main thing, which is much easier said than done even in doing theology.</p>

<p>The crying need in Roman Catholic theology finds an analog in contemporary Reformed catholicism. We Protestants used to know our Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, and Thomas as well as our Roman interlocutors. Moreover, we used to be concerned with the nature of reality, the nature of truth, and the unity of knowledge. Perhaps it is time for us, along with Rome, to steady our spines with some corrective surgery from the great doctors of the church. Where to begin?
