				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://peres-blancs.cef.fr/etienne_renaud.htm"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-328" alt="Etienne Renaud" src="https://dash.dedeo.tk/wp-content/uploads/etienne_renaud.jpg" width="200" height="286" /></a>Daniel Martin Varisco’s moving, three-part memoriam (<a href="http://tabsir.net/?p=2220">1</a>, <a href="http://tabsir.net/?p=2221">2</a>, <a href="http://tabsir.net/?p=2222">3</a>) for his recently deceased friend, Père Etienne Renaud, includes Renaud’s <a href="http://tabsir.net/?p=2221">pastoral letter concerning Christian-Muslim dialog</a>. Born out of his experience as a Christian missionary to Muslims in West Africa, this letter is worthy of pondering insofar as it is full of the expensive sort of wisdom won by lifelong commitment to deep, loving, and real engagement with Muslims.</p>
<p>Consider Renaud’s take on Christian-Muslim dialog:</p>
<blockquote><p>True dialogue, the one in which you are wholly committed with all that you “are” can but be witness, and hence mission. The important thing is to promote with every man a true encounter, which will be both dialogue and mission at the same time. A Tunisian Professor, Mohammed Talbi, speaks of a mutual “duty of apostolate.” Since the truth of the encounter implies that at the end, each one should be able to state his inmost convictions with complete frankness. It is an ideal rarely achieved, rarely possible even, but towards which we must always tend, and which proceeds through absolute respect for one’s interlocutor.</p></blockquote>
<p>His comment on avoiding the easy temptation to abstract “Islam” from concrete relationships with Muslims is as insightful as it is apropos, perhaps especially so among Western Christians:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is essential to remind ourselves that Islam does not have only one single face and we need to guard against making global judgments, a sign that we have few contacts with people in the concrete things of their life.</p></blockquote>
<p>Finally, his encouragement to walk the gospel’s “knife edge” fosters a healthy, realistic missiological perspective on Islam over against idealistic dreams or skeptical rants:</p>
<blockquote><p>In this we must not be naïve or nurse any illusions, underestimating the difficulties of the encounter. I believe on the contrary that we need to look them straight in the face and that irenicism does not pay. But on the other hand, let us take care not to sink into scepticism and cynicism. The Gospel invites us to remain on a knife-edge: “Wise as serpents and innocent as doves.” To be both realistic and evangelical at the same time: two words which apparently are opposed to one another, but isn’t the Gospel a realism of a higher order, the only one which lasts from the viewpoint of eternity?</p></blockquote>
